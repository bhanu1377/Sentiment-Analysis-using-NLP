0,We purchased this car as a commuter for my wife really not expecting an exceptional vehicle for  dollar13500 out the door My feelings have changed after making several day long drives really taking a liking to the car With 266 miles on the odometer were getting 39 miles per gallon on the interstate really great on a car that advertised 34 MPG Hwy Secondly it handles exceptionally well and is comfortable to drive 95 percent of the time I drive a full size truck never paying attention to the fact that your constantly scrutinizing your size in a given space it does weigh on you in commuting This is a nice car and were actually discssing getting another in the Pontiac version So far elated
1,"After driving this vehicle for almost a year as of this review  22107 I have a few minor complaints 
1 The display for the radio unit does not show very well on a bright day This appears to be a nonstandard size unit I would replace it if I could buy a off the shelf unit and just plug it in without a custom adapter kit Honda needs to change this design 
2 The top of the windshield needs to be better tinted or make the windshield smaller Both the driver and the passenger have to use the sun shade to keep out excessive sun light even when not driving into the sun 
3 The head lights seems to be aimed too low"
0,I bought my SS 24 Colbalt with 147 on it White with black interior has everything I wanted power everything awesome stereo sunroof This car is just the best ever for the price I paid and the competitors was prices just right and not over 20k for the options I wanted I drove the Civic Si the new Sentra Se R Tiburion even Saturn Ion Quad Coupe also the Pontia G5 the cousin of the Cobalt All these were either over priced or didnt have what I wanted to pay for Chevy has finally got it right and I got the last White one in the area for 2007 sorry I love it from the moment I saw it I wanted it Love a first sight so to speak
1,Total let down everyone told me how great Honda is and I bought it My friend picked up a golf and it is wayyy better This cars just feels cheap It looked kinda cool at first but after taking it all in I see that there cars are not as good as the rest of the honda line up
0,It is larger than you first think The engine is terrific The size of the whole car is just right Big enough to carry 4 people small enough to be fuel efficient and powerful enough to not require a V6 The stereo is a great design and a joy to work although a little more power would be nice The paint job on my Cobalt is exceptional I bought the paint protection I think it is well worth the price for any car Overall a great ride for not much money I looked at Focus but I think the Cobalt is a better car for less money
1,ridiculously great car that was cheap and it will be paid off this summer too
0,I was ready for a new car and wanted to spend less than  dollar15k The Cobalt was a nobrainer The 2 door laser blue coupe looks fantastic and I got it with all the goodies I wanted for under  dollar14000 Ive owned it for a few weeks and I have only a couple of complaints The doors are long and lockingunlocking them is awkward power door locks should have been standard No armrest whats up with that The interior of the doors are all one color light gray Adding a darker gray to the door would have looked sportier and hidden stains better Window crank handle fell off in my hand after only a few uses just snapped it back on and all is well Gas mileage seems OK a few more mpg would be nice
1,We have 34000 miles car has been back to dealer for service any time the computer hit 20 percent At this mileage we have to replace 4 tires and were told WE HAVE TO CHANGE ALL THE FLUIDS AND FILTERS AT A COST OF  dollar49000 This will be repeated or higher cost every 30000 miles My old Mitsubishi with 170000 miles did not cost me this much We are considering trading
0,This is the first new car I have ever had Good car for the  dollar15000 I spent after taxes I have a middle of the road model with power windows and air conditioning One irritating problem is that after owning the car for five months I am now hearing a sound of something loose or rolling around in the front enginetire area of the car whenever I make a moving right turn and sometimes a moving left turn I took it to the dealer and they claimed that only one of two mechanics who looked at the car could hear the sound They stated that did not know what was causing it and could not fix it I dont understand since sound is obvious and I am continuing to press the issue with dealer
1,I bought the fit as a commuter It is the most fun car in the economy class Makes a boring 20 mile commute a little more bearable Great Interior room my truck sits idle now that my fit will carry all but the largest and dirtiest stuff Decently built for the price and tons of safety features for the kids and myself Looks like a smaller Matrix Not a goofy echo or yaris
0,Engine has plenty of power for a 22 So far the mileage holds true 24 city 32 hwy Steering is effortless but tight enough to feel the road Handling is tight through the corners and the Pirellis hold the road even in the NW rain Interior is excellent with all the comforts of the 21st century Overall I give the car and the experiance an A
1,"Repacing Toyota 03 ECHO w70k I miss her 6500

0,With 6000km behind me I can say that Im very pleased with my purchase The powertrain is superb and interior space provides comfort thats completely devoid of tacky gimics common to the Japanese competition Handling is very good for a FWD car but the ride is stiff The brakes will send your dentures through the windsheid and the gearbox has an American feel to it Longish throw but having solid positive engagements Its really nice actually and it feels strong To my eye the body styling is beutiful in its simplicity despite the wing GM did not cheapout with this platform Tested at the Nurburgring it shows
1,No problems or silly mark ups put down payment on one of them and it was at the dealer in two day with everything my fiance and i wanted Great little car that hardly feels cheap or little
0,I traded my favorite car I have ever owned a Chevy Tracker for a new Cobalt I was afraid of switching to a small sedan I love it It drives great It is nice to look at The paint is a deep blue that the sun sometimes reflects off as purple Getting 314 mpg citydriving combined Perfect big city car Its a winner of a car if you dont have to have the biggest one on the road
1,Have about 5000 miles Great little car Roomy interior and seats are extremely comfortable Expensivelooking interiors Great gas mileage I get average between 3239 MPG in city I dont drive like I stole it Helped 2 friends moved with this car They were super impressed with how much room this car have its like having a truck almost Its safety features are  For the price you cant go wrong
0,The Cobalt SS supercharged is a truly great car Its fast reliable and perfectly built The features it comes with make it fun and its good mileage makes it cheap to fill up Since the car is so light and it has 205 horses it can accelerate extremely fast
1,I bought this car May 31st and have put approximately 5500 miles on it since I travel all over southern Oklahoma for work I have been very pleased and have avg between 36  38 mpg on the road and 32  35 in town I drive as much on the freeway with 75 mph speed limit as I do in small towns at 35 and am pleased with performance of both Not as comfortable as my Odyssey EXL van but not as costly either and I am not tired after a long day of driving so it is fine I would buy it again and consider it a great decision for a car
0,Just got the car a few weeks ago as a new daily driver to replace my 97 Sunfire Ride is very smooth Ill be going down the highway thinking Im doing 65 and its really up around 80 Handling is nice and tight with minimal torque steer Ive been getting around 31 mpg however its only a 13 gallon tank so it seems to go quicker than what youre averaging Overall for the money its hard to do better The car is leagues ahead of the JBodies it replaced Just will have to wait and see how it holds up in the long run
1,i just purchased the Fit WOW this car has some pep to it From 040 its pretty quick but then after that it slow down a little Can feel the bumps in the car a LOT Car feels really light no dead pedal and even when you leave your leg up there is a little bump right in front of the seat it feels a little uncomfortable Other that that the car is great Love the inside and out
0,Got my Cobalt early this month and totallyl ove it Personally I love the look of the coupe much more than the sedan What caught my eye was its low price Although the price had me skeptical  coming from a Chevy oriented family  I had to give them a shot Car is very responsive great on sharp turns and fun to drive Getting to know it I would have preferred an SS  but I got what I can afford My friends simply say the more you see it  the more you get to like it Speaks for itself Great start off car for a teenager parentals This is my second and wish I would have had anything similar to it as my first
1,Acceleration onto a highway or passing requires some thought The Auto could end up being deadly slow The paddle shifters cannot be used when there is any angle on the steering wheel Because it is an economy car there are compromises The carpeting is about 2 steps above roofing felt paper With a little more HP and torque this car would be an absolute hoot
0,The gas mileage is great The small car grows on you as you drive it Fun Easy to maneuver turning radius 33 Decent pick up for the on ramp Safety scores high Gave the car to my DD and am now considering another one after shopping Mazda Honda Mitsubisi and Saturn Cant beat the price and quality mileage and safety without all the options nickle and dimeing you to death
1,This little car has lots of interior room Gets great gas mileage But I am giving it a poor review The paddles that are position behind the steering wheel used for standard transmission will engage if you are driving in automatic at lets say 70 miles per hour I accidentally tapped it when I used the turn signal and the car down shifted and went into standard mode The car immedialty slowed while the engine reved up I was terrified It goes back into automatic after a few seconds but that long enough to cause an accident
0,What can I sayGM did it again This is a huge upgrade from the Cavalier I was a big fan of the Cavalier z24 and im a bigger fan of the Cobalt I got the upgraded sound system with ten inch sub Wow good job I never had a white car but this Cobalt looked great in whiteThe handling is great The all black interior is very smooth Great on gas I drive great distances to work and backall i can say is wow The car has the needed boost to get past those slow drivers with no problem Great bang for the buck
1,The looks are nice but comfort wise its awful No middle arm rest hits hard at bumps turns are tough For the money its expensive
0,Its a great car for someone looking to not spend over  dollar20000 and still have some room and functionality Great trunk room along with easy to function stereo driver information center and cruise control Smooth drive with decent gas mileage in town21 mpgexpected 2528 but lower than advertised
1,The vehicle feels real soild very little body roll in the turns A little more pickup from a dead stop wouldnt hurt Plenty of leg room for 4 big adult
0,This car is so fun to drive I used to have a Sentra Specv and this Cobalt SS is so much more fun I love it
1,I replaced a 1986 Civic Si with this weak sister in April Big mistake My Si got about 15 percent better fuel economy and would run rings around my Fit Top speed in 4th gear 5200 RPM 101 top speed in 5th gear 83 No kidding 83 MPH Disgusting Oh mediocre acceleration as well
0,I bought my 2007 Cobalt LS coupe in September of 2006 and I love it The performance for the money  dollar12850 is mind blowing The handling isnt too bad either I can sling the passengers around and a tire never slips not so much as a squak Refined suspension and a fairly powerful 148 hp stock engine make for one heck of a back road driving experience especially with the easy to operate 5speed tranny If stock isnt for you dont worry GM makes more than enough goodies for this car and if they wont do think about it this car is probably Americas best compact car Aftermarket companies are drooling right now
1,This car is just everything I wanted in a vehiclea mini SUVtype that is practical yet fun to drive It is unimaginably responsive I was surprised that on the open interstate I easily took it over 90mph and not once did it feel out of control or blown about by larger trucks In fact just about anything is larger than the Fit but you dont feel that way inside I sit up so high that I feel that I am in a big vehicle and have to stop myself from taking on a Hummer It is the tiny little thing with a big bad attitude
0,After a lifetime of fast sports cars I just totaled one ouchDecided Id get a bare bones econobox for cheap insurance to tide me over til the new Camaro debuts After looking at all the others I picked the Cobalt I love this car Fun to drive decent power and mileage plus it looks great in Victory Red Love the tail lights Lowered it with Eibach SportLines bigger rimsBFG TA KDWs spoiler full tint sheepskins Im gonna keep her as my daily driver after I get the Camaro Highly recommended Big bang for the buck  Chevy You won me back
1,I think that the car is expensive Sometimes I regret buying the car I guess it is ok and if it lasts for a long time then it is worth what I am paying for it
0,I bought my Cobalt brand new in 2005 so Im sure by now Chevy has tuned the model up some But overall it is a decent car I would have tried to get rid of it but they do grow on you The ride is good and the handling is great You would expect fuel economy to be better from a 4cyl though The worst parts about it are the interior design and room The backseat isnt comfortable or roomy at all and the trunk opening is tight Headlights are average and on long drives it can get uncomfortable Worth a look though
1,Everything about this car is great with 1 exception  no engine temperature gauge The warning light will go on only after the engine gets hot What a lack of foresight for such a great automobile company Does this mean people who buy this vehicle should not take out of town road trips Of all the design innovations why were the folks at Honda that dumb to not include a engine temp gauge I live in Phoenix Ever tried driving up to Flagstaff AZ with the air conditioner on It would disappoint me if I have to do a Fred Flintstone number just to travel north due to engine overheating
0,This car is a whole lot of fun all around I think it is best on roads that have a lot of curves The ride is a lot better then I expected
1,Its a great car and a lot of fun to drive However I have a major problem with how Honda has marketing their Ipod Music Link It leads you to believe that you can scroll through your music with ease from the audio controls It does not offer a display instead there is a horribly annoying electronic voice that seldom works I should have left well enough alone with the AV jack and not added this expensive and worthless feature Save your money dont buy it
0,I find the car handles well and picks up fast once you hit 3000 rpm HP is actually a whopping 226 Outperforms a Corvette in the slalom and is kind of sexy in appearance Watch out for potholes because the car doesnt handle them well I owned a 90 Z24 prior to the SS and wow what a step up Keep up the good work GM Look out imports and V8s
1,Was about to sign the papers on a Civic EX Sedan and then spied this A much better choice and tons more fun It takes a little used getting to going from an F150 to this but I dont feel unsafe when trucks or SUVs gang up on me on the freeways This has been out in Europe since 2001 so I wasnt afraid to buy its first year run in the United States
0,It seems like time stops when im in my Cobalt SSSC It handles great and I love the interior all the options and what the factory offers for me for aftermarket Really a lot of car for the price Just writing this makes me want to go out to the back roads again
1,Ive had four new Hondas over the years plus one Prelude I bought used I thought I could trust Honda to build a good car Wrong My wifes car is a shorter 95 Tercel 2DR automatic The mileage is low on the Fit because the Tercel is more fun to drive for all smallload trips both grocery store and Xcountry Heres why Seats too low no lumbar support paddled steering wheel uncomfortable body too wide turn radius parking traffic ride jittery and steering too quick needs constant attention on frwy instruments poor and disappear in sunlight fast cornering not fun windshield posts too thick pedestrians transmission gasps mileage mediocre The brakes are good
0,This Cobalt I have is such a dependable sporty car Wherever I go I cant help myself but to put the pedal to the metal with it Its just awesome
1,Great sporty little car A lot of interior roomLooks small on the outside but a lot on the inside I put a 8 ft book case in back The car handles excellent Great cornering ans stabilityThe gas mileage less than advertised30 mpg on highway and about 26 in town Still ok but a lot less than advertised In the winter time the windows fog up very easily Very frustrating
0,I love this car It is fun to drive Handles great Fuel mileage is pretty good too I average 265 townhwy and 31 on the freeways The sound system in it is awesome too Taking corners is awesome in this car I think with a custom sway bar it would be better All in all I love this car The good outweighs the not so good The few things I dont like is the emergency brake and the middle console are on top of each other making the emergency brake difficult to access Seems to have a bit of a lag in between some of the gears and 1st is way too short
1,I love my Fit I live in the city and the Fits small size makes parking a breeze But Im also a performer and I need to haul all manner of costumes props and set pieces to and from shows Despite the Fits deceptively small exterior I can pack a TON into the back And when Im not hauling a full load of cargo my two dogs and I pile in and we can zip around town My only criticism is in regards to gas mileage Ive never achieved the 3138 mpg range advertised I average about 26 mpg in the city and if Im lucky 30 mpg on the highway Other than that no complaints at all
0,This car is exciting powerful and fun to drive It makes my communte to work enjoyable Days off even more I have a Mercedes CLK 430 and it rarely leaves the garage now Performance upgrades frome GM are great and inexpensive and make a huge difference
1,I wanted a small vehicle with plenty of room for cargo and low gas mileage This FITS the bill
0,We purchased this vehicle after having driven a rental vehicle of the same type for a monthWe were pleased with the way the rental drove and have been equally pleased with the purchased vehicle We havc a five on the floor tranny and it is a great deal of fun to drive The gas mileage has been much better than we expected running over 30 MPG for most of our driving which includes city highway and rural driving
1,We like the Honda for its loading room We are not getting the mpg that the dealer said it would 30 real world mpg is 25 city   and 28 hwy when we got it new the mpg was better We fill the honda is a city car only the ride is too rough for a long road trip over 100 miles cheep sets and 63 250lbs not much set under you I had an maz 323 1987 that road better
0,Looks great Handles very well around corners Good size engine and a nice radio upgrade from the 06 to the 07 model Only suggestion is to have better quality speakers Other than that a great car for a good price
1,Good acceleration for a low hp car Great gas mileage I average well over 40 mpg Handles nicely tight Good visibility Holds a lot of stuff for a little car
0,Roomy and comfortable car with a large trunk Low exterior noise Window handle and seat belt keeper need to be of better quality
1,Terrible seats and driving position no armrest nor left foot rest Automatic transmission has a 34 second hesitation when you step down on it at low speeds 24 mph before it downshifts to 1st gear This is very dangerous at intersections and has almost gotten me tboned on several occasions They are all like this according to Honda who could care less I drove 2 others and they have the same hesitation Honda should be forced to recall the automatic Fits and fix this dangerous defect This has really soured me on Honda even though I had no problems with previous Hondas Not enough power Gas mileage less than expected Handling cargo capacity good Can hardly wait to get rid of it
0,This was the car my parents bought for me Its a 5 manual but still is fun to drive Ive had no problems with the car Easy to handle and quick standard engine Gets ok gas mileage in city and highway mileage is great Love the smooth ride
1,Now have 37000 miles and out of warranty No reason to go back to the dealer except routine maintenence Still look forward to driving it daily Ive read many comments and heres my take Who wants to steal 10 gallons of gas when pickups hold 35 gallons No need for a lock IMHO Plenty fast just accelerate in the 4  55K rpm range It can take it all day 4 people with AC in hilly territory  yea you have to row it some But with 4301 gears it jumps off the line Small tank  its OK cause I keep enjoying confirming the 35 mpg average I get using all 109 HP Ive forgotten about the dead pedal issue No lit vanity mirror locking glovebox and armest not a deal breaker
0,I bought my cobalt the night after my high school graduation I bought it for  dollar11988 with 15389 miles on it But the night I drove it home when I hit my very well maintained gravel driveway I heard a loud thud coming from the steering Well the dealership replaced both steering shafts but now 17000 miles later at around 31500 miles the same shaft need to be replaced It all was under warranty but now I am worried about it going out at 4500 miles not under warranty but over all it is a very flashy car especially with a loud exhaust gets the cops attention I love the stereo and the interior design And I am getting 265 mpg driving around town and I once pulled 356 on a road trip
1,I really have only one major complaint the automatic transmission It lurches and bucks on acceleration Also when braking or coasting to a stop something under there is helping me stop It is called the engine braking system In theory I suppose its a good thing But it is very annoying It makes the car surge when it upshifts I feel like I am losing control Im very disappointed with this little bucking bronco Otherwise the car is great Great features stereo great handling Good performance once I get it up to highway speeds The gas mileage is a little disappointing I get 28 to 32 mpg Was hoping for mid 30s Wish I had waited for a 5speed manual
0,Just bought my Cobalt Supercharged with 1400 miles on it Was a demo The car has been so much fun to drive Getting 40  miles per gallon going easy on the highway The sport red color with the 18 inch chrome wheels is awesome Other than an occasional minor rattle might be beacuse its wintertime this car is absolutely a must as long as youre not worried about a small backseat or using it for construction projectsI have a 2004 Avalanche that I now can use for carting my gear only Im now saving a lot on gas and wear and tear The bottom line If youre looking for a fast and fun car to drive youve got to consider this car Feels like the old days Power with no worry of fuel
1,Cute car good throttle response Very weak engine on just rolling hills  always downshifting Car would be hell to drive in mountainous terrain Have no idea why Honda did not and does not swap this 15L for the Civic 18L Increase HP from 109 to 140 with better gas mileage engine would still fit No brainer from my perspective Have 3000 miles over the first month and have been getting 28 30 in 5050 cityhighway driving Terrible should be getting at least 34 and on straight highway at least 37 MPG Message boards do seem to vary a lot on the mileage reports Honda why cant a 2600 pound car get 35 for mileage when my 2003 Civic averages 33mpg city and 36mpg highway
0,Bought this car new in March of 2007 and currently have just over 20k miles The selling points of this vehicle were the gas mileage and comfort of the interior considering its size The sticker stated 24 mpg city and around 30 mpg highway On the highway the car gets the 30 mpg but in the city Im lucky to get 17mpg I have a 1999 Subaru Outback with 189K miles that gets better mileage in the city Very dissapointed The car its self is pretty reliable I had it to the dealer 5 times 3 for the same problem I think the 5 trips to the dealer speaks more for the dealership than the car Finally if you get this car step up to the LT model No power windows or door locks gets tiresome
1,Ive owned Hondas in the past and found them reliable so I blindly chose the Odyssey when it was time for a minivan Big mistake This huge mini van drove like a bus was difficult to park and had problems the dealer was not able to fix At 20K miles the rotors warped the front tires had to be replaced and the front wheels were constantly out of balance At 25K miles the engine mounts failed followed by the torque converter and the AC It vibrated all the time while driving and the dealer could do no more Reading the reviews on this model year I found Im not the only one with these problems I just traded it in on a Sienna and have never been happier
0,My Cobalt LS 4door has been a great purchase and a terrific commuter car I bought the car new for a very good price which included a rebate dealer discount and GM Card credits Out the door with a 100K mile warranty set me back  dollar128K The car has 15000 miles on it and it has not needed any repairs thus far The car is very reliable and runs flawlessly I do the maintenance myself which is very simple Im pretty tall and I find the driver seat very comfortable drive about 60 milesday so Im in the car about 2 12 hrsday The car gets 30 mpg and has plenty of pep The car handles pretty well for a small car
1,Van drives like a truck Bad front end New tires did not help Dealership just makes excuses Brakes squeak and factory rep and dealership say to read the owners manual and it will say you may have squeaky brakes They will not correct them Owners manual comes after the purchase How dumb is that
0,Ive had this car for over 2 years now and have 45000 miles on it I had to order the car because I could not find an SS with a five speed and all the options I wanted So I hadnt test drove one when it was orderedIve never had to take it in for service but did replace the brakes and rotors at 40000 The interior aluminum paint has started to chip from wear and tear and the steering wheel leather has started to fade I previously had a 2005 Grand Am GT and it was in the shop twice in the 2 years I owned it The Grand Am had more get up and go than the cobalt but it was a V6 automatic Decent car for the price but some improvements could be made Back seat is extremely comfortable for a coupe
1,Like many other owners we too are having transmission issues We just had to the dealer for the transmission judder fix but guess what Its worse than it was before Vehicle shakes at 25 MPH while transmission hunts for a gear especially on hills There is also an intermittent shake at highway speeds 70 MPH that I no longer believe has anything to do with tires or alignment but with the drivetrain itself Like others when enteringexiting ECO mode there is too much noise from the transmission The VCM system does not seem to improve gas mileage so I say Honda should eliminate it Weve had 7 Hondas now and this is the first and only Odyssey we will own
0,I have an 07 SS Coupe I drive a lot My gas mileage has been less then desirable with getting at the most 27mpg highway I have 42k on it now and at 40500 I had to have my transmission replaced Thank goodness for extended warranties or it would have cost a fortune Styling is great I get a lot of looks from people because the car looks hot in black Tires are expensive to replace and the SS is so low to the ground it doesnt clear most speed bumps without scraping Unless you get a great deal on this car I would think twice
1,We purchased this van brand new without knowing that the tire system was different All four tires unevenly wear out after 20000 miles on it eg they wear out on one edge of the tires but not the other side I brought it to Firestone and it was said that the alignment was bad which killed the tired I brought it to Hondas dealer and all they said was that they were not responsible and I had to pay nearly  dollar1500 to replay a new tire Its sad We have purchased 4 Honda and surely this van would be the last one In addition this van is not very fuel economy eg 20 miles on freeway and 15 miles in the city bad Dont purchase it if you dont want to pay more than its worth
0,For all of you out there that buy foreign because of the so called superior reliabilty this car is for you Well built fun to drive excellent quality for your money
1,Sorry to blast a vehicle that is so highly rated but mine has had recurring problems and they appear to be electrical When I turn the lights on the dash lights go off the cruise control only works on occasion have been to Dealer 3 times to correct a bad tire pressure sensorstill not working and light still on the battery has been replaced twice in a year All in all this is my first and probably last Honda product because it has left me stranded 8 times in one year with a dead battery My 14 yr old Quest never stranded me once
0,My wife and I bought this car for her commute 40 milesday So far excellent value Paid  dollar10k for used 07 LT CoupeAutomatic with air cruise tilt pwr windows locks CD player etc 26000 miles Good mileage 35 consistantly on highway 2830 around town Very quiet inside almost no wind or road noise 100k mile enginetransmission warranty nice plus Considered a Civic or Corolla but nothing this new with a decent warranty could touch the price Would of had to buy a 5 year old Civic or Corolla to get to our  dollar10k budget
1,If you need a minivan this is definitely the one to buy so practical high quality it carries so much stuff that it would be difficult to go back to a sedan We had an Accord then we had a baby if you need to cart babies and baby stuff around its great Im a bit disappointed in fuel economy I cant squeeze better than 23mpg even when I try really hard
0,The base model seems to be the most car for the money and the quality so far seems to be competitive to leading imports Even the most basic model comes with standard features that other cars in its class dont come with It is also easy and inexpensive to perform your own preventative maintenance oil changes on too I like mine a 2 door standard transmission because it is sporty economical and practical I did extensive research before buying it and had the most confidence with this purchase
1,We just bought this 07 Odyssey and have only had it 1 week but so far this vehicle is very well built extremely comfortable and performs and handles very well for a minivan First tank of gas I averaged 20 mpg with mostly city driving Im expecting this to improve as the engine breaks in I read one review that said they got 14mpg on a tank and I couldnt believe it how were you driving In fact most of the negatives I read about this vehicle was on gas mileage but I guess those people never owned SUVs I traded a Mitsubishi Endeavor SUV which was a great vehicle but we wanted the extra seats and better fuel mileage So far so good Ill write another review when I get more miles
0,I am 6 7 and am very happy with my LS I tried getting into most all the other compact cars and I just could not fit in them I have not had a single problem with the car since I purchased Perfect commuter car I get about 3031MPG combined and get 36 37 MPG on the highway
1,Mileage on the sticker is a pure lie and cheating In growing family the gas expense is burden now When asked dealer they said 16 for city and highway combined is good Per dealer can get sticker mileage if driven without AC heater radio navigation DVD and at smooth 55mph Sure why do they have these feature than Why are they selling in cold Chicago If DVD has to be off why put it in Minor touch of metal or so creates dent due to thin paint coat No MP3 format player no iPod outlet for such an expensive vehicles Does not have mileage calculator built into Nav system Same software used in Acura and others should have throwns into this
0,My previous car was a 2003 Dodge Neon which i must say after the 1st yr needed a front end jobyuk Ive had the Cobalt for 15 months now and not a problem Good power Ride is good Electric steering needs a little improvement Great gas mileage I get 30 around town On long trips at first I was getting around 40mpg automatic tranny now around 3839mpg Dealer installed cruise for free I love it
1,This is our first Honda Fortunately we leased the vehicle and it will be going back to the dealer Nice exterior more than enough power better features over the same priced Toyota Main complaint the window sticker says MPG 1825 and we get 1422 under normal driving conditions 12 MPG in summer when air conditioner is running We lease vehicles and then buy since we do not trust manufacturers Honda should be ashamed that they mislead consumers with MPG ratings This only confirms our suspicions are true
0,I have owned my SS for about a year and love every day driving it I have got as high as 40 mpg on the highway and ussualy around 3032 around town Love the ride and love the performance
1,So far 800 miles and enjoy the car Very roomy with good added features like AC power outlets magic third row Car is not sporty since it lacks the low torque power but still can handle the roads when needed Kids love the car with the nav and cant get them to get out Drives well considering its a minivan and road pavement is more pronounced since it has pax run flat tires basically a steel tire inside a tire The ex model is much quieter 18in wheels are low profile and looks aggressive The Sienna looks docile Since we just purchased it will update review when it snows since we live in northeast Wanted awd but not an option Cant believe Honda doesnt have one available like Sienna
0,Seriously whats not to like about the Chevy Cobalt Having long been a GM fan Ive never really considered buying a compact GM vehicle I always figured I would have to buy an import to get the quality and value that I desired to add to my fleet of fullsized GMs Well my 07 Cobalt has proven to me that GM can make a good reliable compact car Im not a small guy 62 and 245 and this car fits me like a glove The seats are supportive and there is more than enough leg room I can easily keep up with my sons 07 Scion TC and get WAY better fuel economy when doing so Overall this car cant be beat if you are looking for solid economical transportation
1, had been researching and fallowing Odyssey for last 5 yars and heard nothing but good from the owners and mechanics Finally I got my own and I love everyting about this van After having cChevy Astro for 6 annoying years there will be no more GMs in my family I had the Odyssey for almost three month already and 2600 miles No complains yet except for the poor gas mileage but I was told it improves with more miles If you have kids recomend to get a van with DVD player I bought van without DVD and my wife and I suffer during the long trips
0,Before I got this car I had a 2000 Chevy Prism that was amazing So to compare the two has its ups and downs The Prism got way better gas mileage With the Cobalt it probably get about 2529 MPG where before I was getting at least 35MPG Its really stylish and I love the MP3 jack Getting on the highway is great because it doesnt take long to get up to speed I didnt get power locks or window and thats the biggest regret It stinks to have to reach over and unlock doors and manually roll down windows Wish the radio would crank up a little louder also I love the digital display for the information center However I wish OnStar and ABS was a standard Overall pretty good and fun to drive
1,This is one of the most uncomfortable vehicles I have ever been in It is noisya constant hummm the transmission runs very rough and the dvd screen constantly squeaks The van also has a vibration problem which you can feel and easily see when looking at the seats and the steering wheel It never goes away not even when ac is off The inside of the van is very nice and roomy The front seats are way to high for short people though I am 53 and only the tips of my toes touch the floor Hard to reach pedals Wish I bought something else Maybe that new toyota that didnt even start at the dealership would have been a better buyat least then I would have no vibration worries
0,This car is fast It almost has as much acceleration as my 750 cc motorcycle Makes short work of an  dollar80K BMW This car is so much fun to drive Looks great and to boot 40 mpg highway out of the 20 I chose the Cobalt due to the fact I had such great experience with the Cavalier Car is loaded with everything you could want Great job Chevrolet Thank you
1,Driver seat is for dwarves arm rest is for people with 20 waist the navigation is a joke If you do not know where you are this thing will not tell you as it has very low resolution and streets are not seen on the display just a grid of lines nobody knows what streets they are Icons only appear at 18 and 120 better take a look your self trough the windshield you do not need the GPS when you can see it trough the window Voice activated turn on radio and the system will turn off the AC All orders are confused seems only speaks Japanese Air conditioner is to be used in the North Pole or so not in Miami or the tropics does not cools enough in resume no worth the money
0,This car was designed with safety as its priority I just got my Cobalt and already I have the controls memorized By looking at the great gas mileage and the simple but stunning interior you can tell this car was made by a practical onthego person Dont let the small size fool you This car has the most cabin room Ive seen in a sedan Not to mention the vast trunk room Great great car you get every dime out of it
1,The 2007 Odyssey with the variable cylinder engine sacrifices city mpg for hwy mpg As we use our vehicle predominately for city driving the average mileage of 14 mpg is significantly worse than our 2003 Odyssey average of 19 mpg If we had known we wouldnt have bought the vehicle Sorry in CT with 2 12 years to go
0,In these trying times our auto transmission LT sedan has shown outstanding gas mileage Over 28 mpg around town all the time It isnt suppose to be that good says the EPA but well take it Its a fun car quieter than many other four cylinder cars in its class We bought it used from a local Chevy dealer and after three months no headaches
1,We bought our Honda after looking at the top three rated this year  Toyota Honda Kia The Toyota didnt have as much bang for the buck as the Honda not as many creature comforts The Kia has terrible depreciation so would have to have a bigtime Gap Insurance and is cheap looking The Odyssey has been great Weve taken it to 3 dogs shows tons of room for crates grooming supplies luggage with room to spare Comfortable ride and GREAT mileage It gets much better mileage than my little Malibuand theres hardly any road noise Weve owned the big Dodge custom vans a Ford Aerostar etc so were not newcomers to the van market
0,My first two cars were a Cavalier and Sunfire The Cobalt by far is of much higher quality and is made far better I originally was considering the Aveo when I went shopping for my 3rd car but the quietness and smoothness of the ride got my hooked to the Cobalt Its wonderful to drive in the snow I feel very safe in it After a 9 hour road trip its still comfortable
1,Quick notes 1 How can this car be without day time running lights 2 Some of the interior feels cheap 3 The passenger side armrest is an ergonomically AWFUL and skeletally unfriendly design you will need muscle relaxers on a long ride 4 This car guzzles gas Driving just a mere 14 miles cost me a quater of a tank You can practically see the fuel gauge move 5 The second row middle seat is a poor design and the storage entry below seems not thoughtfully designed The hand sized opening is ridiculous in view of the cavernous storage area You cannot possibly reach items that are not within a few inches from the opening but there is no way to keep items close to the opening
0,This base model 07 Cobalt had me thinking twice about 4 cyl engines As soon as I took off in this car the performance was great It handles really well on the curvy roads where I live in and the fuel economy is outstanding 30 MPG I was also surprised by the amount of space that is present in the trunk lots of it Being that Im 6 feet tall I have enough room to sit behind the wheel I was also surprised to see the battery in the trunk
1,I have put approximately 10000 miles on the van since I purchased it It has a smooth ride and more than adequate power The DVD and nav systems have been great I have noticed that gas mileage is not as advertised 35 mpg less than on sticker Also as time goes by the drivers seat has become a problem As I come to a stop slow or fast the seat slightly shifts forward with an audible click As I hit the gas slow or fast it shifts slightly back and clicks again Dealership serviceperson states that he felt the shift and click but tested another van in the lot and it did the same thing so it must be normal What
0,Ive had my Cobalt for about 6 months now I brought it brand new with 3 miles on it As much as I drive I already have almost 11000 miles on it and it still rides brand new with the brand new car smell I road 6000 miles over before I got my oil changed and the light still hasnt came on I much money am I saving The car is beautiful
1,My new 2007 Honda Odyssey drives and performs relatively well but there were two key areas where I am simply not satisfied My biggest disappointment is in the Odysseys horrible gas mileage far less that what is quoted by Honda I only get 15 mpg in city At over  dollar3 per gallon this is outrageous I can almost see the fuel gauge dropping as Im driving down the road In addition Honda Co decided to save money at the consumers expense by no longer including basic items like cargo netting middle row compartment lazy Susan etc in their 2007 models as they have in previous years It was a let down to find this out after purchasing the vehicle
0,We got this car out of pure necessity our previous Neon was on its last leg The Chevy Cobalt seems to be a much more solid car than the Dodge Neon The only thing we needed to go back to the dealer for was the window sealingtrim falling loose from the door seal What a great way to get from point A to point B without breaking the bank
1,The van itself is really good However the PAX tires are HORRIBLE Paid extra to get the touring edition after 29000 miles tires were worn out Had to wait over a week to get new tires in cost over  dollar200 per tire to replace Brushed one up against a curb and the part of the brand new tire peeled off Honda would not replace it I feel like I was ripped off by the PAX tire and by Hondas lack of willingness to take responsibility for the problem The tires wear out quickly and are difficult to get replaced in a timely manner This is the only tire available for the touring edition
0,I bought my LS on a whim Just went to look at cars and test drive some and well it just kinda happened Within 2 weeks I had to take the car to the dealer there was some major squeaking going on Found out it was just the hubcaps apparently theyre horrible They lubed them but nothing else can be done Im now at month 13 of ownership and sitting at home with no car It has 12000 miles on it Went to start it and it just wouldnt do anything Called GMAC Roadside assistance and they sent Big Dawgs towing We almost needed a tow truck for the tow truck The car has been at the dealer all day No courtesy car like my selling dealership promised No response yet
1,Pros Its a Honda well built well designed Mileage is a blend of city and highway and averages 192 over life of vehicle Tons of cargo space Decent versatility with seatingcargo arrangements Cons One delivery defect deep scratch on dashboard Unlocking rear side doors is very confusing Exterior green paint looks like they forgot to add enough green pigment Option packages too pricey
0,I got a great deal on this car and I love it This car is great in the snow if you know how to drive in the snow It is also very fun to drive not too sporty not to grandmaesque It is comfortable and reliable I can fit my crosscountry skis in the trunk if I fold down the back seat
1,Horrible gas mileage noise rattle in door panels from speakers even when radio volume and bass is low Transmission shifts very hard
0,Car runs well no problem under the hood but its built crappy After a while car rattles on highway when pushing on brake This car is not reliable I bought this car Feb of 2008 and traded it in for a brand new Scion tc this month Car is not worth it
1,7000 miles on it since September 2006 For travel convenience space interior flexibility and features its a perfect 10 It handles well has good power and lots of cool features So far perfect Honda reliability The kids can climb in without help and play Nintendo on the DVD player The worst thing is front seat comfort with not enough thigh support and a seat doesnt go back far enough Temp guage and odo cant be seen together Dash contols like rear AC system can be confusing 28 mpg is a lie We get 21mpg on highway at 75mph DVD screen rattlessqueaks when down Nav system boots up slow and repeat disclaimer a nuisance Rear visibility not great but rear camera helps
0,I have had my Cobalt for just less than a year now and I have to say I am very pleased over all First off I got a great deal The car is definitely more than I had expected I find it fun to drive and very comfortable even on long trips The car is gorgeous from the outside and the interior is very nice for a car in this price range It has just enough power to make me happy If I wanted a race car I would not have bought this The handling should be more that adequate for most drivers The ride is much softer and more forgiving than most cars in its class Overall I think it is a vast improvement over the Cavalier it replaced and a great value for all that you get
1,Hesitationslight bucking at most speeds as if the engine is misfiring or transmission is slipping harsh downshifting excessive windexterior noise in the cabin lurching forward while stopped with foot on the brake rough ride Navigation system is almost useless unless the address is known Some keys on keypad dont respond Try using the placename feature and it is almost a guarantee the system cant find the placename you are looking for eg WalMart Costco certainly not the nearest one Instead the system displays places hundreds or thousands of miles away from your current location My  dollar500 Garmin portable NAV runs circles around the  dollar2000 Honda NAV system
0,I love it I looked at new cars for two years and I really enjoy this car I purchased victory red leather interior sunroof I could not ask for anything more and the estimated mpg is better than the sticker I am getting 28 city 37 highway and the warranty is wonderful I suggest this car to anyone Very sporty sexy So far so good
1,This is my first Honda and I am sold We had a Town and Country for 4 years and the rattles wind noise and drafty interior drove me nuts I bought the Odyssey and left 2 days later for a 2000 mile trip Not only was it quiet no need to turn up the radio but in the dead of winter there were no drafts What I cant figure out is why all the vans are not made this well The gas mileage has not quite been as advertised but then most vehicles are not I wish the doors would unlock when I push the remote to open the sliding doors my Chrysler did and I wish I could lock the doors while the sliders are closing you have to wait until the doors close Great vehicle buy it
0,I am a larger man at 62 and I find that the Cobalt has the best leg room of compact cars The Cobalt also offers a quiet ride and very good stability We owned a 2005 Focus SES and this is hands down a better car and it is less tinny The power is decent and it offers a full compliment of standard features for a decent price We paid  dollar11500 w only 13500 miles on it
1,We purchased the van at the end of December and have put a little over 3000 miles on it I had a 2005 Toyota Sienna which I traded in that was probably the most annoying car Ive ever owned with its transmission problems and clunks clanks squeaks groans etc So far the van has done very well with the following exceptions 1 It has a chirping scraping hissing noise that isnt real loud but it is annoying especially at 30 mph and 1500 RPMlouder when you first start out 2 Gas mileage is poor17 combined city and highway and 19 on the highway 3 It misses when idling and jumps a bit when the AC compressor goes on   and off
0,When we received our Cobalt we found both front power windows were off track After the first rain we found an inch or two or rain in the front drivers floor board The dealer was able to align the front windows but was unable to fix the water leak A second dealer was able to reduce the water leak I believe that they had to bend the door The arm rest blocks the emergency brake There is no ash tray for collecting small items that you want to dispose of
1,This is a disappointment after owning a 2001 Fit  finish are not as good Cabin noise is only slightly improved Fuel Economy with the variable displacement has been about 16 mpg around town Max mpg of 20 on a 200 miles trip
0,I previously had a 2007 Cobalt LT Coupe The car was ok but was missing power I also hated the fact that the car came with hubcaps which made loud noises on every bump I wanted an SSSC but was unable to get one at a good price So I decided to get a Cobalt SS and wow Big difference from an LT 17 chrome wheels Pioneer sound system interior is way better than my old LT The 24L engine is so powerful it reminds me of my old 94 Camaro V6 I did change the wing to the high rise one that comes standard on an SSSC only because I think the wing makes my Cobalt SS stand out more
1,We researched the Sienna and this one and finally went for the odyssey because it drove better and looks better overall than the Sienna in my opinion On the inside they are both pretty competitive and I did not find anything that stood out that was better than the other The Sienna had all these confusing package options with not all option packages that you like available in all regions This is a mess On the contrary Honda has implemented a simpler scheme where you have 4 or 5 basic packages and individual accessories on top on them to choose from A nice van overall
0,Love it What more is there to say Actual gas mileage could be a bit better for this vehicle Fun to drive accelerates like a speed demon when needed but this is a SS engine   and body not a 2 cyl attractive Chevy you did it again for the mature cost concious driver Thanks
1,I drove my van off the lot once after the papers were signed Big mistake Bad vibration in the steering wheel Service Director is great but after 7 service visits Im a little irritated Oil leak still trying to determine from where Engine backfired today The tires and wheels have been replaced once working on the second time I wish I had better things to say OH my gas mileage finally improved when I hit 5000 miles I average 19 in the city I think the steering is a little to sensitive so I seem to oversteer a lot It does great in the snow The seats are very comfy The interior plastic scratches really easy so I tell the kids dont kick it or let the seat belt hit it
0,I love this car It handles way better then my Integra did and the low end power is there It pulls through the rpm range very strong Shifts are very quick with no drama Seats have lots of long haul comfort I take this car 600 miles in a weekend just about every month and its a blast to drive
1,The MPG is deceiving It said 20 in city and 28 Freeway I got overall about 19 to 20 MPG I hate the DVD player Intermittently it scratches my DVD I took it back to the dealer to have it fixed to only have them do nothing They blame on my DVD My DVD is just like any DVD If you cant reliably play my DVD then you cant play 9999 percent of the DVDs out there It seems like the player does not hold the DVD snuggly I had that similary problem with a DVD player at home it keeps scratch my DVD when I got a new player it solved the problem
0,Great car with good gas mileage performace quiet good ride quality and handling
1,I researched every domestic minivan on the market By far the Honda was built the best It has the smoothest ride plus it doesnt feel like I am driving a bus The Toyota felt cheap and dont get me started on the Chevy Honda must have gone to great lengths perfecting their van Its a Ten
0,This car is extremely fun to drive The LDS helps keep the torque steer under control and the bolstered leather seats adorned with embroidered SS logos hold you firmly in place while accelerating Driver be warnedyou will quickly climb the RPM band with this supercharged power plant The throws are short and the gears engage with ease beware of the sportingly short clutchnot a bad thing The car handles incredible through both the curvies and the straight aways Not to mention the gas mileage has been incredibleespecially for a supercharged engine Id definitely pit the SS SC against the imports any day
1,My husband talked me into buying a minivan because it would be more economical Out of all of the minivans we test drove the Honda Odyssey was the best with the Toyota Sienna in a close second However if you are wanting an economical car with good gas mileage do not buy this van There is many cool features such as the rear view camera Rear Entertainment Center the fact that you can open and close the doors and hatch But overall I do not think it is worth the money Therefore we took it back and are getting the GMC Acadia Seriously check the Acadia out I think it is the best crossover on the market
0,This is awesome A joy to own and drive The cobalt leaves all the competitors in the dust Great performer on the worst roads in America Chicago and suburbs Mileage better than sticker estimate Love this vehicle Modern sleek lines seats are super comfy for 5ft to 6ft tall drivers Battery in trunk makes good sense Can ride for mega miles with no back or neck ache which occured with my Toyota Lincoln and Suzuki Feels solid and sound proof Which was a great surprise to all of us We plan to continue to see the USA in our Chevrolet Cobalt
1,Purchased in early December and took a 2000 mile road trip averaging 235 mpg on the hwy Handles extremely well
0,For the first 3K miles this car was great Then the noises began Car constantly makes both a squeakingchirping noise and a loud snapping sound around the bpillars like the car is breaking in half over bumps and during turns The sunroof also rattles and its switch repeatedly falls out of the headliner Mechanically I havent had any problems in terms of the engine transmission suspension etc But when your car is a rattle trap its hard to enjoy it All my cars have been American and theyve been great and lasted for years However once my loan is paid off Im going right out and getting something else
1,We just moved up from a 2000 Odyssey The difference is absolutely astounding The 2007 is quieter has more power and is significantly upgraded on the interior Weve only had the 07 for a few weeks so gas mileage etc has not been really checked yet My only complaint is with the IPOD Music Link system which is just awful We were told the Music Link would work through the radio and Nav system this turned out to be a false statement The only good news is our dealer has agreed to pull the Music Link system out and give us a full refund
0,Great little car for the price No problems after 7 mos ownership Handles well excellent acceleration for a small enginekeeps up with the bigger vehicles on the freeways with no problem For a basic affordable vehicle with no frills ie manual locks   and windows its a good choice So far Ive only had one small problem with a rear door lock
1,This is my second Honda Odyssey that Ive purchased as a new vehicle from the dealer After about 30000 miles a problem developed with a noise sounds like an old clunker It sounds like a transmission or a valve noise on acceleration especially on the highest gear when the car is under even slight load Honda is stating per Honda Engineer that this is a normal noise even thought Honda dealer already replaced shields transmission torque converter and other parts but they refuse to actually fix it They have done about  dollar3000 worth of repairs and they refuse to replace a transmission which is probably cause of this noise I Will Not Buy Honda ever again
0,I love my Cobalt I have never driven a car that drives so smooth It is such a fun drive and was the car that stood out from all of the rest that I drove I love it I would highly recommend that you consider a Cobalt for your next car
1,I have gotten 30 000 miles on the no flat tires by driving longer than I should  dollar1200 to replace Car hesitates at 60  65 mph Dealer says this is normal Air noise is bad in the car Brakes have been replaced twice They finally got it right at my expense The gas mileage is no better than 14 mpg in town driving I have owned many Hondas and this is the first one that has been a total bad experience
0,Here comes the underdog It has a supercharger it makes boost whenever you press the gas The engine puts more horsepower to the ground then its rated at and has dominated every form of racing it has been used in Brake performance is exceptional especially when you consider the cars price class and weight Ove all the best bangforbuck performance car in the last few years
1,We really like the Odyssey minivan but the fuel mileage is absolutely horrible I agree with many other reviews I knew we were not getting good fuel mileage and finally checked it on a beach trip We averaged a very poor 172 mpg My parents averaged over 18 mpg in their Chevy Tahoe Other than fuel mileage being much less than advertised we really like the vehicle
0,Love it Its like a relationship it takes work Theres somethings to get used to but for the price its an unbelievably great buy Get a sunroof if you can its a great feature that I find myself using everyday weather permitting
1,Wonderful van with the exception of the steering issues Read all the problems with alignment and steering with these vehicles extreme pulling memory steer difficulty aligning steering clucks steering resistance etc etc I dont know how this vehicle got such high ratings in all editorials without anyone noticing the irregularities with drive and alignment Dont buy it Seems as though some must be OK but more than one would think have issuesbelieve me and the others when we say this
0,Cobalt LS 4dr with no options With almost 4 months and 5000 miles I think this is going to be great commuter car 3134 mpg mostly highway commute to work Great AC and adequate radioCDmp3 Comfortable front seats and adequate rear seat room Big trunk Added aftermarket cruise really just expensive switch factory servo controls are already there Plastic wheel covers and small tires will be replaced with alloy wheels and bigger tires when appropriate
1,I would not consider another Honda until they fix the excessive road noise Too bad because the vehicle is excellent in many ways On a rough surface noise will prevent normal conversation with rear passengers
0,The Cobalt is more capable and fun to drive than any of its competitors
1,Dont buy one with PAX tire system Class action lawsuit against Honda in process Tires wear out between 20K 25k Expensive to replace Can only be done at authorized location which is usually Honda dealer No spares Ours went flat traveling on Sunday and had to stay over until next day when Honda opened New tire cost  dollar298 because old could not be fixed only 16k miles on it Hotel cost  dollar100 Honda said so sad too bad We are going to get rid of ours even though it is a great van Dont want to get stranded in middle of nowhere
0,My last small car was a Toyota Tercel after which I drove trucks for 14 years I testdrove and looked at every other small car I could find before buying this I am currently driving it locally around town computer says average speed 21 mph and like the 29 MPG Im getting after putting a whole paycheck into my truck every month Its nimble turns very tight and has decent acceleration Since I dont drive very fast at all I love it The drivers seat took some fooling around to get comfortable but my long legs are happy This has the same engine as our 05 Malibu which has run perfect for 2 12 years now We did buy the center armrest for our LS I recommend it
1,My Odyssey is built very well no problems through 25000 miles My complaint about the car though is the fuel mileage its as bad as a huge SUV Car gets 14 mpg city 22 mpg highway Dealer first told me to wait for it to break in now he states its normal wow I am shocked and disappointed with the mileage Beware if you buy this vehicle youll spend big bucks for fuel
0,This is my first econo car since I bought a Pinto in 1978 Im not crazy about FWD but it has real grunt and Ive found it easy to hot rod I also feel good about saving a couple Americans their jobs and while the quality isnt what Im used to neither is a 22k sticker All in all Id consider another Cobalt but I would prefer RWD
1,Two issues with my Odyssey First it shakes when you are slowing down The dealer stated it was due to tire pressure Took it in and it still shakes Second my van was steaming and hissing one day I took it into the dealer The service guy did a 15 sec look over and informed me that it was probably a hole in the condenser caused by a rock He said they would have to perform a check that would take an hour and that this would not be covered by my warranty as it was not a factory defect Guess what yep the check revealed that it was a small hole caused by a rock How he knew that was beyond me Cost with the check was over 1200 I found out that many many people have had the same issue
0,I have owned a Chevy Cobalt for 4 months now I have 2500 miles on it I really enjoy driving this car It handles well It has good pickup and is easy to drive My daughter also likes to drive my new Cobalt Everyone whos sees it likes the way it looks It ia laser blue metalic It is comfortable in the front and back The features are great You can program up to 36 staions on the radio The driver information center is cool Lots of good info available on it miles per gal oil life percentage 2 trip odomoters fuel range outside temp and a couple of other things too Highway driving I get 3234 MPG The rear seats fold down so you can get larger things in the trunk
1,This will be my last Honda or Japanese product The build quality is terrible on this thing It rattles and squeaks with only 4000 miles on it I had to have the whole Nav system replaced Every bump in the road makes the cd player skip My other car is a honda too 2004 Accord It has already had the transmission replaced on it as well as not wanting to run in the wet or cold weather Japanese quality Never heard of it
0,Bought an 07 LS coupe in May this is my first new car and also my first GM car Have to say Im very pleased so far Love the exterior looks love the dash and interior layout plenty of space for me and comfortable seats excellent gas mileage currently getting about 297 city fun to drive smooth ride great features automatic headlights auxiliary audio jack MP3 player affordable all in all a great car to own and drive
1,"I love the honda mini van because of its comfort My moms car is much more bulky and hard to view things she has an old toyota sienna Lastly I got my odyssey a little while ago and have had no problems at ALL
Sincerely
Kathy"
0,I was looking into something sporty and reliable The black Chevy Cobalt Coupe not the sedan  wasnt fond of the four door definitely had both Cant beat the price under  dollar13k  brand new Especially for what it has to offer Ive had my car for about half a year and it still responds as it did the when I put in its first miles Its not the SS of course but you gotta love the pick up and handling The gas mileage is average  I guess I was expecting a bit more but not bad to be honest This car is great for 2 people and if you want to put some people in the back front seat gotta scoot up depending on peoples size Love the overall design but mostly impressed with its price
1,We bought a 2007 Odyssey EXL during Hondas annual clearance event in October 2007 and saved about  dollar4K on MSRP The EXL has the VCM variable cylinder management feature that shuts off up to 3 cylinders when not needed It is very unnoticeable to all but the most expert drivers and adds up to an average fuel economy over 25 mpg with every tank of gas for our family We added an Alpine Overhead DVD system for the kids and saved another  dollar1K versus getting the EXL with factory DVD besides the Alpine has a bigger screen mommy controls and game playing features that the factory DVD does not have We added luggage racks and use our Thule Roof Box for cross country trips for added comfort
0,I really like this car a lot Its my 1st brand new car and 1st 4 cyl Its a blast to drive for what it is and I love the sound system I love the laser blue i was told there was only 1 more blue 5 speed like it within 200m radius My old cars were TAs so its still slow to me but its quick enougbh to be fun and handles very well in turns I got a lot more than what I was expecting for this little 4 cyl Now to get a procharger
1,Honda failed to compensate for the added weight of the pax tires and the results are continual steering wheel vibration longer braking distance tire balancing issues road noise and a poor overall driving experience
0,I recently purchased this car and am nothing but happy so far It is my daily commuter and I have nothing bad to say so far It gets me to work and it runs great Good on gas and very fun to drive Anything beats my old Crown Vic on gas but this one is great This is no race car but it gets out of its own way very well
1,I did not have any transmission problems until I had my Odyssey for about a year I have had it into the dealer three times and they tell me that there is not a problem Apparently they hook it up to a computer and it tells them there is not a problem so no problem exists in their mind My vehicle chronically searches for a gear at low speeds It also has a shake to it when trying to maintain a lower speed The dealer looks at me like Im crazy but I have 2 other friends with Odysseys and the same complaints I wish Honda would stand behind their product before their reputation is ruined for good This is SO disappointing We traded in our Toyota van for Honda and wish we hadnt
0,Like we all say fun to drive great looks great price Good choice Was pulled over once already with 800 miles on it warning
1,The only knock I can give this fine vehicle is the road noise This probably from the tires No problems except a broken AC radiator which was hit by rock kicked up on the freeway The dealer fixed at no charge even though it was not a equipment failure I dont know how much VCO helps mileage but it must since it is active even while cruising at 70 mph
0,I bought my new red Cobalt LS 5speed 2dr coupe about 3 weeks ago This is my first new GM vehicle and I am very pleased with it so far It is comfortable and fairly quiet and has a very nice interior layout The EPA rates it at 2534 mpg cityhwy but I got 336 mpg on my first tank and 359 mpg on the second My commute is 20 miles each way mostly Interstate highways but including weekends I expect that it is about 25 percent local75 percent highway driving I am driving efficiently but I still keep up with traffic on I95 7075 mph I use the AC as necessary It isnt as powerful as my 86 Mustang GT but is still quite fun I am very pleased with my purchase
1,I put on 2000 miles a month I get about 20 mpg in town and 2325 on the highway at 6065 At 7075 on the interstate its about 22 mpg Nothing to complain about there The car is more comfortable than the Grand Caravans Ive owned or than my sons 08 Sienna The feel on the road is much better than the Sienna for me as a driver or passenger Ill get about 35K on the PAX tires and then Ill dump them and the rims WheelMax has the replacements and various Honda dealers online have the tire pressure sensors at  dollar35 apiece The whole switch will cost what new PAX tires would and then anyone can repairreplace a blowout
0,I bought this about a month ago and have around 1150 miles Car drives smooth with little outside noise Very quiet engine Electric power steering seems to working well with no problems The interior is nice however a bit nicer door panels couldnt hurt Sunroof is quiet and a pleasant option to have Seating in the front is very comfortable Drivers side lumbar support is a nice feature however it doesnt really make a huge difference Instrument gauges are cleanly arranged and the stock stereo is very nice I love the features and the XM that came with it I have the 16 tires instead of the stock 15 and I think it gives it a cleaner beefier look Gas mileage is best at 65 mph
1,Three of the seat belts have a nick on the edge of the belt I can tear the belt material with my hands at the nick I understand these belts are design for tension force but should any belt develop a nick I sure the tensile force would be reduced Honda quoted  dollar385 to replace belt
0,Bought my new 2007 Cobalt in July 2007 pulled off the dealer lot to get groceries and noticed my front running light was out on the passenger side of the car Went thru the first tank of gas fair gas mileage started to hear a rattle in the front passenger side of the dashboard started to rattle after 800 miles on the Cobalt Should have gotten a Honda Civic EX
1,I called myself researching extensively prior to purchase and overall I am pleased with many aspects of my Odyssey the things I am most unhappy with seem trivial but I find annoying My 1998 Explorer had more features than my 2007 EXL Cannot charge my phone with ignition turned offthe radio is horrible and believe me I am not one to complain about radio sounds but this is very bad The lights do not come on or off automatically No MP3 or bluetooth  I just assumed most of these features would be present purchasing the next to top of the line would have bought the touring except did not have option on tires the bumper is scratched   and i see this with most I see on the road
0,Its very good on gas yet fast at the same time which is great The acceleration on this car is really good and the handling is perfect If you are looking for a fast car and want to save money on gas at the same time I highly recommend the Cobalt SS supercharged
1,My Odyssey drives well The driver seat is good and supports the drivers back Driving a Toyota Sienna for few hours every day caused me back pain the Odyssey is much better Gasmileage is poor 17 mixed cityhwy 4060 percent and 185 hwy with or without Air 70 mph Driver only My other vehicle is SUV with 45L engine much heavier with 340 Hp does 14 city and 19 Hwy Sales sticker 1926 Honda dealer found that the Gasmileage is within spec Another problem is the paint that peals of the bumpers My 2004 Odyssey had a similar 35L Engine but gas mileage was 20 cityhwy
0,This car has it all from great looks to awesome handling The brute force in the supercharger is amazing and the Stage 2 upgrade makes it feel like a whole different car
1,We bought Odyssey after driving a 2001 Caravan to 138K miles The Caravan rode better than the Odyssey and got better mileage Sorry but its true Weve taken a couple of long road trips 3000 miles and the Ody does well but it does seem louder than it should be and the mileage is very poor The 3 cylinder fuel saving pitch is a joke Why cant it beat my 2001 Caravan in MPG Im very disappointed in the mileage My wife an I are Realtors in our 40s and she wanted navigation because the map books are becoming harder to read when getting around We do like the navigation but it seems to be 2 or 3 years behind in the streets included Most newer neighborhoods are not in the GPS
0,This car is incredibly luxurious considering it is close to  dollar20000 I love the performance handling comfort sound system fuel economy shifting styling and overall just in love with my new Cobalt I wish they would continue making the Cobalt
1,Weve had our 07 Honda Odyssey EXLRES for about 6 months Like everyone else says the MPG is horrible In the third month dealer had to replace the fuse box because the wipers would only work on high brights would not work and car alarm would not arm  major annoyances The exterior and interior of the van are nice The shifting is VERY uneven and like another poster said is very pronounced when coasting I never thought I would miss my Grand Caravan but I do
0,Great car for the performanceminded driver on a budget Plenty of power for what is typically expected of a 4cyl FWD vehicle It looks great tooThe 18 gunmetal rims look incredible in all lights Luckily Chevy offered an optional low spoiler option for 07 because that was the only gripe I had about the car Gas mileage is excellent as well With a 5050 mix of cityhwy driving I get 2527 MPG and have got as high as 34 MPG on highway cruising Very competitive in its class You may find slightly nicer interior finishes on the competitors but not enough to pass up the incredible whine of the blower at full throttle Great sound system and the ipod jack is really useful
1,I hit a deer on the right front side on the interstate doing 70 mph It hardly felt like I hit anything The kids were to busy watching the dvd in back to notice Its a credit to how the van was designed The front bumper hood right headlight and right passenger door had to be replaced with a pull to the unibody frame by the headlight 9k bill to the insurance company
0,This car was my first purchase I absolutely love how much room you have in the back and front seats when compared to other similar sized cars Also has great trunk room for storage or traveling My Cobalt also has excellent gas mileage It only takes  dollar30 to fill up my tank and lasts me for two weeks of going to school and work Ive noticed that it also has great quick acceleration that comes in handy when on the interstate Im definitely satisfied with my Cobalt
1,This is a great minivan I dont know why all these people are complaining about gas mileage I usually get 20 MPG
0,I cant say enough good things about this car Absolutely amazing no problems great mileage super fun
1,This van has too many design flaws when I compare it to my 8 year old Dodge Caravan which I traded in I could tolerate design flaws but I cannot tolerate transmission bumps when shifting up and down shifting The dealers expert mechanic says that this is how all Honda minivans shift Not comfortable to feel sudden bumps when going from 60 to 70 mph Many Honda user forums also complain about this bump The engine also makes a lot of noise when driven between 4060 mph The dealer again says that this is how it is Unacceptable The bumps and noise make driving experience horrible
0,I traded my 2005 Cobalt base coupe for the SS hoping for excellent performance it delivered This car is absolutely a blast to drive In fact Ive had the car since September and have put 20000 miles on it because of the funtodrive factor My only complaint about the interior is lack of an armrest Other than that kudos This brings the fun back to GM I would definitely recommend or buy another CobaltCobalt SS For the money the car delivers so much more than most of the premium imports that I drove before purchasing my car
1,This van turned out to be very noisy and hard riding On the test drive the car performed well  had a good ride and didnt seem noisy After arriving at home I checked the tires as is my practice and found that the tires wee inflated at 28 psi although the door sticker says 36 is the recommended pressure Think the dealer did this on purpose I keep 32 psi in my tires We took a 2000 mile trip right after the purchase and found the road and tire noise to be very bad and the rough ride made the trip very unpleasant Gas mileage is 1618 My 99 Chrysler T  andC got better mileage and had a far more comfortable ride Its a good looking vehicle but not the superior allround on that I expected
0,I am 63 and love this car It appears small from the outside however the leg room is amazing The seats are comfortable though a little too stiff if you are making trips of 60 miles The gas mileage is great 28 MPG so far The five speed gives you a lot of control and the engine builds power all the way to the red line of 6500 GM offers performance exhaust and a stage 2 kit that will put this engine at 250 hp Add an after market intake and you are looking at 260 hp in a very light car Awesome handling I live near the dragon in Tennessee and I can tear through it much quicker than I could in my old Camaro though in fairness the Camaro did not have low profile tires
1,We have NEVER been so dissatisfied with this purchase Traded a 2002 Sienna w60K that had better gas mileage and was TROUBLE FREE Tried trading this unit back in to two different Honda dealers now with 8K BOTH will only offer 4K BELOW TRADE Must be because of the maintenance history Engine throttle appears low was reprogrammed still the same Windows fog on wet days takes forever to defog Headliner coming apart at windshield Sunglass holder broke Stone dead battery at only 5K Have had SEVERAL electrical issues shorted out headlamp switch and relays Sometimes doors dont unlock We wish we still had our old Toyota What a mistake buying this van
0,My First car I ever bought This car did alot of 5 hr trips to Mammoth Mountain Also it was my commuter car Easily hit speeds I shouldnt have been driving and very roomy Love the fact that I could fit 6 people in there and did it often I am still beating myself up for trading this car in for a Jetta Ugh the jetta blows compared to this truck
1,Purchased this vehicle to replace horrible Dodge Caravan Very happy with Honda except for the use of very cheep interior plastics and poor fuel economy 1215 city 1720 hwy The plastic around the glove box cup holders and floor boards have many scratches and look worn
0,I have owned this truck my First for a few months now and love it It was used with a little over 9000 miles on it Very easy to get in and out of Have the 4 cylinder model which has plenty of power for me and is good on gas Everyone who has been in this truck comments on how smooth the ride is There right takes bumps and bad roads very well Just one heck of a smooth ride i still am amazed to this day how nice it is The interior is not as nice as it could be but is not that bad either in all i am pleased with this purchase
1,We have bought only Honda and Toyota since 1976 This Odyssey makes a loud noise after driving on the highway for a few hours Maybe power steering Dont know and the dealer says they would not be able to find it till it is happening which is never when I am in town or when they are open I am thinking to trade it for a sienna Never heard of not finding a problem like that Dont they have computerized systems that find problems Not happy with service at Springfield Honda so may trade If I do I will never buy another Honda Want this dealt with before my warranty is up
0,I have enjoyed this regular cab truck after reading the edmunds review my resonse is this is a truck not a muscle or luxury car I average 21  23 city 25  27 highway with the I4 it has plenty of power I had the bed fully loaded taking my sons stuff to Iowa from Michigan I got 24 on the way there and 27 on the way back empty I have had no major issues with the truck It is comfortable to drive and I am a big person Plenty of leg room
1,Salesman told me I would do better than the Toyota Sienna I traded in which was a lie Toyota Sienna got 19 combined cityhighway and 28 highway Honda Odyssey gets 16 12 combined city highway and 21 highway which is a big disappointment
0,All in all ownership has been all that I expected and more Gas mileage is better than I expected Power is good for a 4 cylinder
1,Loved this car at purchase now five months later its problems are obvious Gas mileage for city driving is the worst  low teens at best Couple this with a transmission that is way too eager to downshift the car will not coast at low speeds  foot must always be on the accelerator and you have the king of all gas guzzlers The brakes are too soft and getting softer by the day  really emphasizes the cars bulk when your leg hurts just trying to get it to stop These flaws make it impossible to enjoy driving this car I would expect these kind of issues from a soso vehicle but not a Honda Wont be getting one again Cant believe I miss my old Caravan  
0,The back seat head rests are so big you cannot see out the back window I have to keep the back seat folded down to have better visability My in town mileage is 13 to 14 miles per gallon with the straight 5 cylinder engine This really upsets me
1,Loved our old Odyssey but it started having problems Now we get in our brand new Odyssey and the first thing I think is I HATE THIS VAN every time it rains all the windows fog up so bad we cant see takes over an hour before they defog  told its a common complaint Gas mileage is worse than horrid Impossible to get feet warm unless you sit on them  heated seats work Cant put anything under the console between the two front seats If something even lightly touches the arm the tray goes down has only happened when the coffee cups are full and of course hot Cant drive with the windows down the noise is ear piercing Id trade it in for a different Make if I could afford it
0,I have been very satisfied with my Colorado except the service departments bloopers They created more problems than the truck would normally of had It has needed work but I would not trade it for any other I get an average of 269 to 286 mpg I guess it depends on how you drive I do a lot of hauling with it and have pulled my 10 trailer with no problems Going up hills it has more power than expected and here is West Virginia that is inportant for all we have are hills I would recomend the Colorado to anyone as a small economy truck the tires stink and were dry rotted so be careful but they gave me new ones after 15000 miles
1,Never should have traded in our 2004 Odyssey This car maybe gets 13 miles per gallon no matter how we drive The automatic doors need to be repaired There is a radio antenna in the window so the reception is poor at best A tremendous amount of interior noise Problem with transmission Van always bucking when you decelerate Unable to duplicate they say All in all a piece of crap Please do not buy this Van Honda should be ashamed of themselves
0,Ive done 13500 miles in this truck since new without any problems It runs really free and has high gearing The ride is smooth and handling and brakes are great I can get 26 mpg if I drive easy Id recommend it
1,We bought ours new in March 2007 The interior heats up very quickly however hardly any air comes out down by your feet Cant even feel it It will blow a little harder if you turn off your side air vents but then your side windows start to fog up My sunroof leaks while in the car wash have been sprayed right in the face many times The windows will sometimes roll down by themselves whether you are driving the van or in the store shopping I was actually locked INSIDE the vehicle once Everyone else got out and when I tried to the door wouldnt budge The locks were all up I had to lock and unlock them to get out Very scary if you have small children and most van owners do
0,We purchased this vehicle to replace one of our Security fleet Chevy Cavaliers Vehicle has excellent acceleration comfort for driving and setting in Fuel mileage is near 30 MPG in city   and hwy driving combo Have used to pull a loaded 8 trailer   and didnt notice any changes except fuel mileage dropped to 24 MPGon the hwy As a security vehicle we have engaged in high speed chases with many different vehicles The Colorado hasnt been outrun yet or outperformed
1,Has both 08 Sienna limited and 07 Odyssey EXL Navi Like about Odyssey stereo brakes and handling Dislikes rough ride 2nd row seat is too firm 3rd row seat is too narrow Naviscreen is big but has less resolution and color Plus the rear view camera uses cheaper CMOS sensor Which makes rearview camera useless compare to Sienna Dont like all of the door switch is on the driver side No door switch on the b pillar Biggest gripe Gas mileage is horrible Averaging 143 My Sienna gets 207 The old 04 Sienna we owned averaged 213 through 70k miles
0,I enjoy my 2007 Colorado Crew Cab Z71 4x4 I get about 18 mpg on a tank with the 5 cyl and Automatic trans 75  80mph on highway Keep in mind I have the trailer towing package and 373 gears which are deep I have the limited slip rear end so I have a true 4x4 I dont think 18 mpg is too bad for a truck like this One tank I got 20 mpg Its solid well build far and away better than the S10 which I also owned Unlike the S10 my Colorado is comfortable enough to use for those 1000 mile trips I just wish Chevrolet was bright enough to offer the diesel engine which is available in the Isuzu 370only in Japan but it is the same truck as the Colorado and Canyon
1,Bought 07 EXL as compliment to our 08 Sienna since cost is so cheap Things i like about Odyssey handling and steering response is great Excellent brakes Audio is better than  dollar35k Sienna Things I hate Rides too stiff The power sliding door control is located on the driver side No sliding door control on the bpillar Honda also cheaped out on the rear view camera and LCD screen for the navi The rear view camera is not as clear nor as colorful as the Sienna it is almost totally useless The gas mileage is just horrible At 1100 miles Odyssey is averaging 143 mpg The Sienna at 1500 miles is averaging 207 mpg The old 04 Sienna i had averaged 213 mpg through 70k
0,I now have owned the truck for 9 months and have almost 11000 miles on it I am still very pleased with this economical reliable everyday truck Im still getting 1920 mpg in everyday driving even when running the ac with 2627 mpg on trips at 7075 mph no less The only repairs it has needed in 11000 miles are a new drivers seat cushion to fix loose upholstery and a new HVAC control head to fix a temperature knob that wouldnt go all the way Other than those two minor things its been completely reliable Im a very satisfied owner and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend the truck based on my own experience
1,We turned in our 2004 Odyssey LX expecting to get better performance from the redesigned 2007 LX It turned out to be one of the worst vehicles Ive ever owned over the last 43 years behind the wheelIt seems like we visit the gas stations every time we take it out And as you can seewe only travel an average of 7500 miles per yearI would estimate the true MPG to be around 10 MPG CITY and about 18 MPG highway Pathetic I should have opted to keep the 2004 LX Another factor to stay with the Odyssey was the convenience of the side door windows that can be opened We hardly use them because of the excessive pounding thumping wind noise that occurs when youre going over 15 MPH
0,I replaced a 2001 GMC Highrider or ZR2 with the purchase of this Z71 4X4 Big difference in build quality between the two with the older model far exceeding the new models parts No skid plates on new truck rear drum brakes opposed to disc on the old model however this does get good milage and is a good everyday truck I have taken a couple 200 mile trips and vehicle is very comfortable and capable Time will tell how reliable this model is old ZR2 is bullet proof and is still in the family son drives it and is going strong with no problems at 110K miles
1,Traded our 05 Pilot because we needed the convenience of a mini van Tested the Odyssey and Sienna Althugh we liked the features of the Sienna more the Odyssey drove and handled much better Biggest dissapointment is with the fuel mileage With our AWD Pilot we got about 19 overall With the same type driving in our Odyssey we get 16 Also some minor interior rattles and creaks which are annoying
0,Bought the truck used with 16K miles Love the way it rides Power is okay has 4 banger Brakes are noisy when cold and pulsate when hot Fuel mileage is 239 hwy and 19 city Punched it the other day accelerator stuck wide open Hope its not a sign of things to come
1,I have kept a log on my gas mileage since purchasing my Odyssey in August of 07 and bought the Odyssey for its advertised gas mileage I owned a Chrysler Town and Country for 10 years and my 10 year old van got better gas mileage than this Odyssey Im getting 15 city and no more than 195 Hwy My sticker advertises 1926 It is very disappointing Also I have had trouble with the transmission being slow to change gears from Park to Drive Took it in today and they put a computer update on the van to speed the delay but it didnt work It is also sluggish from 1040 mph with the so called Economy feature kicking on and off to save gas Poor engineering for gas mileage and transmission
0,After 3 months I am very happy with my new Colorado I purchased the ext cab model with 4 cyl engine RWD and auto trans I use it for commuting mix of country and city roads and for light hauling Most of the time I am alone in the truck For the way I use the truck it works very well Its economical 1920 mpg It has enough room to carry my stuff and my family can ride along when they need to The truck is comfortable and very well equipped for what I paid  dollar16K The only problem Ive had is a loose spot in the upholstery which was fixed under warranty It may not be exciting or refined But if youre looking for an economical reliable everyday truck this is a good one
1,We purchased our 2007 Odyssey to replace a 2004 Toyota Sienna and I wish I could trade back Fuel economy is unbelievably bad We live in the country about 30 miles from anywhere and have yet to exceed 16mpg Ive tried setting the cruise on a relatively flat road and then reset the mileage calculator  it still wont get better than 17 The instant fuel economy often drops to below 10mpg on level roads and seems to get worse when the ECO light is on The dealer said its within the stated range so too bad This performance should be embarrassing to Honda The Odyssey is only marginally 12 mpg better than my fullsize fulltime 4x4 Expedition with a 54 liter V8
0,I bought a new 2007 Colorado 29L Automatic even after reading negative reviews Im a consumate Chevy fan but must say that Ive had more problems with this vehicle than others I am hoping everything that will happen will occur during the warranty period Had to drop the transmission fix a blower motor and now have a leaky roof brake light Everything has been fixed first time Excellent ride eavy and smooth Good looks and comfortable 22mpg around town 25 Hwy at 74 mph The verdict is still out whether the bugs will all be worked out within original warranty
1,I love the pilot for the roomy cabin great ride driving position and handling I have owned 10 Hondas and this one has not disappointed
0,Really like the truck The looks of the truck z71 is awesome The 4 door has plenty of room inside and I like the interior As for power I think the truck gets along just fine Why people think a truck needs to be faster than an old muscle car Ill never figure out The ride is good for a small truck If you hot rod it it will suck gas Drive it normal and it does real well We average 2228 mpg mixed driving No long trips yet The traction control is annoying When turning into traffic from a stop on wet roads it will make the truck bog then take off Could be dangerous Turn it off and it does just fine Would rather not have it
1,I owned a jeep and the Honda is much more reliable I only go the the dealership for scheduled maintenance and minor problems I would recommend this vehicle to the person who is very busy in their life and does not want to go to the dealership every week for problems When you dont drive aggressive the mileage is acceptable for the size If you drive hard the mileage will decrease I would purchase another one This is my first Honda You really do not have to purchase any other brand
0,Ive owned this truck for several months and have nothing but good experiences except at the pump The ride is great 5 cylinder runs smooth and the transmission shifts perfectly Im not sure about the reviews that say this truck is underpowered compared to foreign trucks with V6s Its a truck not a dragsterI have no complaints on acceleration This is a solid truck I love the people who complain about design features jeez dont you look at a vehicle before you buy it
1,I got this because me and the wife needed not only the extra space but also something that would not strand us when it snows It has all the safety features we need for our two boys 2 yrs and one on the way It yelled at my wife for not buckling up That was awesome The Pilot handles like a dream Whenever I need that extra kick it gives it to me On the snow it responds smoothly with no shakiness I dont know what others had but my wheels have not shaking going past 65 I have gone as fast as 85 with no waggle But the road noise was something else
0,A very enjoyable and capable truck Bought a 3LT Z71 4X4 Gets pretty good mileage 2022 MPG to and from work On a road trip 2000 miles we got 23 MPG Plenty of power when you need it but not the fastest Got leather seats and is comfortable This truck is way ahead of the S10 I replaced Bad side Had issues with steering shaft at 500 miles Only to find out it was a common problem GM knew and then had to wait due to nationwide backlog If they knew this upfront they should have fixed it prior to selling it As a result I have a bad taste in my mouth about GM and we are a GM Family May consider another brand on next purchase But since it has been fixed we have had no issues
1,have had this for only two months and the gas mileage has been no better than 15 mpg we lease and i called to see if we bought another honda vehicle would they consider to get us out of lease response was it would cost us at least 3000 dollars to get out of lease very disappointed with all parties concernedwe had a buick rendezvous and were much happier should have stayed with buick
0,For the price so far it seems to be a great deal It is easy to drive park and to put in the garage The fuel economy on the 5 cyl is debatable but you get more power than in the 4 cyl I would like to see at least 30 mpg not epa but real gas mileage
1,We bought this vehicle mostly because we disliked it the least Coming out of driving only cars I am appalled at how poorly this thing handles Steering response is so slow mushy that I feel like I am sending signals to the engine room hard aport whenever I make a steering adjustment Also I was very surprised that the 6disk CD changer does not play mp3 encoded disks On the plus side the build quality is excellent the engine is quite and responsive and the seating arrangement is very versatile
0,Enjoy the truck could have powerfeels solid handles well leather seats increases comfort seats are larger could be more back seat room would prefere back seat to lay flatter that would give more room
1,I love my Pilot I strayed from Honda with my last vehicle being a Toyota I thought the quality were similar I was wrong Owned Hondas since the early 90s and never regretted it once I feel extremely safe in my Pilot Quiet ride although it is still a truck Very little leaning taking corners at higher speeds Really holds to the road Extremely roomy and comfortable If you are trying to decide to buy this vehicle do it You wont regret it
0,I really think GM could have kept the 22 instead of experimenting with more engines The 22 was great on fuel and performance Yeah I know you say this new engine has more power but correct me if Im wrong dont but a small truck to haul with buy a half ton or more Yeah i know I drive semis I really enjoy the truck all the time though fun little deal
1,Beware before you buy a Honda Pilot The car has lots of peep but that is about it After 65 mph the front wheel shakes like crazy  there are hundreds of complaints on the web about this Honda cannot find the problem We took the car there 78 times Next after a few months smoke began pouring out of the AC and could not be driven Then a few weeks ago an electric problem stranded my wife and daughter who was coming home from the Doctor The next week the same thing happened again Finally the gas mileage is HORRIBLE Just as bad as my Ford Expedition The EPA of 1722 is not even close
0,The truck has everything needed for a small family Im satisfied with this truck and so far so good Interior is not that bad it would be nice if the rear seats are adjustable and more comfortable maybe more cushioning
1,Went with the 2007 Pilot over the CRV to get extra space as we often total 4 adult passengers and sometimes more CRV felt a little tight for 4 tops Preferred the superior quality of the leather in the Pilot CRV leather felt thin and has a tufted look which some may prefer but we dont CRV felt somewhat underpowered but not too bad No question the Pilot has plenty of power Overall very pleased with the Pilot Expecting it will do well in the snow if we get any
0,Truck looks excellent Acceleration is great Been having fuel efficiency problems for the last two weeks since I took the truck in for recall of computer Computer had to be reprogrammed because the truck would not idle upon cold start Truck is brand new 4 cylinder automatic but is guzzling gas like a full sized pickup I got better gas mileage on my old V6 4x4 SUV Dealerships are trying to make me wait thousands more miles breakin before they remedy the problem Ride is fun but bouncy Cheap interior but still nice looking Base seating has absolutely no adjustment worth a darn I like the truck I just want better gas mileage Im averaging 250270 miles on a 196 gallon tank
1,I have owned 3 Explorers 1 Blazer and 1 Yukon and this is definitely the best yet I picked it up on a Friday and went out of town the next day I got 25 mpg on the highway I paid  dollar3000 less than I was quoted on the Toyota Highlander and this is a good bit larger vehicle This has got to be the best SUV in this size class Before purchasing I check the sales prices of 3 yr old Pilots with over 50000 miles and they were selling for only  dollar5000 less than I paid for thes 2007 model Hows that for not much depreciation
0,This is a very nice truck I got the z71 pkg and I have to say it is the most capable 4x4 I have ever owned That is due in part to the new Eaton G80 locker Smooth and quiet nice interior etc Two thumbs up
1,This Pilot AWD with NAV replaces my 2003 Infinti FX35 The FX was a great vehicle with three exceptions Very poor seating driver seat power buttons under your right leg Extremely rough ride in rear seat when driving on anything other than a very smooth road and very poor visibility due to rounded design Honda on the other hand has excellent visibility plenty of glass area plus third row seatingand runs on regular gas plus most of the options I had on the Infiniti for  dollar14000less at stickerAfter looking at big sister Acura decided to stay with little sister Honda Pilot Plenty of Bang for the Buck
0,This is a great truck for its size Its got enough space to fit adults in the back seat and it has a nice size bed The engine runs well and is very reliable
1,For 4 years I had my Honda Pilot 2003 and I loved it It was a very comfortable drivers seat and had a lot of leg room I renewed my lease and got a new Honda 2007 Pilot The drivers seat does not have the same leg room as my previous Honda That is the driving seat does not slide back enough and makes driving uncomfortable Its very disappointing to me
0,I had an 06 CC Colorado that was a rattle box and traded it in The build quality seems to have improved and the truck now has a more solid feel There still is a little too much plastic on the inside but overall this is a fun truck to drive I cant speak to the reliability until Ive had it awhile Steering is crisp and responsive Braking could be a little better The interior cosmetic changes are nice too
1,I know I know to have two of the same vehicle sounds different however we cross the continental divide often in the winter We liked front wheel drive had a minivan but having an extra two drive wheels has been often reassuring One of us is not very hip on the outside design but is comforted by their quality mechanicals Most people who ride in them comment that they will seriously consider buying one also Plainly that is what sells these Pilots Looking to motor in them for at least 10 years or 200000 miles whichever comes first
0,This would be a great truck if it was fine tuned It needs better interior and gas mileage The high back rear seats block your rear vision People say the V6S are better but my 5 will out run the Tacoma V6
1,There is only one area im not having fun with which is the blower When I have the blower Off  I can still feel air blowing on me  I hoped I can change to have the blower blow only on the window but that is not an option the defoggerwindow blower also blows with face or foot This is very uncomforatble  I wish newer version would have this as an option  ie no blow when off or blower to window only and and not combined with face or foot
0,Ive owned my 07 Colorado ext cab 2wd LT1 29L auto for two months so far so good I like the interior dash controls and the perferred power accessory optionThe 6040 split front bench is comfortable but should have a better grade of cloth covering its suppose to be the deluxe seat The 29L I4 has pretty good response and torque mpg is okay The auto trans is very good smooth but firm shifts The build quality and style is quite good Overall a solid American small truck that should service my needs well for a long time
1,A great car to drive My first car with navigation system dont know how i survived without it My previous suv was an Accura MDX The Honda pilot is as good if not better at  dollar7000 less in cost
0,It is a fuel sipping truck It is not as heavy duty as the big trucks like the Tundra but for the money it gets the job done for towing and picking up things when moving I get a combined 20mpg
1,Whatever nice features this car might have they pale when you consider the gas consumption Dont believe the rated MPG It is much worse I get 10 MPG in the city and 17 on the highway The car has over 20000 miles so it is definitely past the breakin period
0,Remember the cardboard and plastic Vega or Pinto from the 70s Well they are reborn as the Chevy Colorado Mine is the 4 door Not even 3 months off the lot and even after the magic coating the dealership sold me a bird dropping ate through the clearcoating and the paint The warranty isnt worth the paper its written on This is the last chevy anyone in my family will ever own
1,5 of last 6 cars my wife   and I owned were Hondas We are very satisfied with them and the Pilot is no exception It rides well   and has great drivers seat room I am 6 4 You definitely wont feel cramped in the car It also is very quiet After 5000 miles I average 13 miles to gallon but I only drive in the city I was looking more for the 17 it said on the sticker If it were not for the gas I would say this car is fantastic
0,It has snowed every day since we bought our truck So far no problems to report with preformance It starts easy runs smooth and the 4WD has performed as it should With gas still near  dollar350 per gallon the 4 cylinder mileage is welcomed Nothing fancy just a good solid truck for under  dollar20 grand
1,The Pilot was great and I certainly would not have traded it in but the mice decided to make it home They had no problem getting in and out of the interior which doesnt work with a young child Other than that and the poor gas mileage 15 MPG I liked the car I do not have the same rodent problem with my 07 Ridgeline
0,I am experienced with the S10 and this model is better than the older model The frame is stronger the handling braking and steering are better and since buying it in Sep 06 Ive had no problems I will admit that the interior plastic could be firmer but I am sure the factory has reasons for the flexible plastic now used
1,I leased my 2007 Honda Pilot last year in summer Just after getting home with it I heard the horror stories about mice I thought OK so maybe some people have problems with mice Hopefully I dont No such luck I just got back from paying the dealership to remove a mouse from the blower housing Wonderful This is not a small problem apparently this is a big one Honda has been very silent about this longstanding problem and is not stepping up to the plate to solve it I must say that we have had mostly ChevGMC products up to this Honda and we have NEVER had a problem with mice I am thinking of putting signs on the windows of my Honda advertising what a mouse house it is
0,This corvette has been a nightmare The first thing was the top creaks when hot and has been to the shop 4 times and still not fixed Both front sway bar links had to be replaced and the entire rack and pinion The drivers bottom seat panel has to be replaced and the battery has been replaced The problems just keep mounting and for a car that costs this much I would have expected better quality
1,I have had my Pilot for just over a year and have enjoyed it minus a few exceptions A clip of some type either came off or was not put on somewhere connected to the transmission in the first place leaving me unable to move in the middle of traffic NOT GOOD I called the dealer from the road and they towed me in fixed the the ride in about 3 or 4 days This left me with one vehicle I wasnt given a good enough explanation of what happened but no problem with that to date The subwoofer is either popping or rattling the areas next to it My dealer so far has not been able to fix the problem to my satisfactionFinally there is a slight pull to the left I will see if the dealer can adjust
0,This was my seventh Vette purchase What a blast There is no comparing this car after 20 months of ownership to any of my previous Vettes What more can I say Ill leave it at wow
1,Hoping this was a good cross for road trips AND towing it good only on road trips Quiet comfortable and great ergonomics inside Typically SUV bulky to drivehandle Terrific reliability In short a great people and stuff hauler It is not a good towing vehicle I have a 2700 tent trailer when fully loaded and the rear end drops considerably and with the severe cut off on the headlights night driving is hazardous due to oncoming traffic high beam warning flashing It doesnt have anywhere near a low gear going down grades and is clearly not an off road vehicle Summary terrific land cruiser not good tower especially at night and on any sigificant decline
0,This is my first GM car in 25 years Its a 2007 coupe with 6M Z51 2LT with about 14K miles Its a dream come true GM has really put together a great combination of performance practicality and efficiency Performance in every aspect will make you forget your troubles for awhile when driving Im pleasantly suprised at the effecient engine compartment layout as well as the well placed traditional interior controls right where they should be The interior while good could use a few improvements However overall this is a great car Only a slight roof sqeak and a differental noise both corrected with known fixes
1,We have been driving this vehicle for about 6 months and have been very satisfied My wife is the primary driver and loves how it drives and carries our 2 children 2 and 4 years old We previously owned a 2000 Odyssey which may have had more interior space but we prefer the SUV layout the Pilot provides The fold down seats in the rear provide adequate flexibility when choosing to haul people or cargo The fuel economy is close to if not better than the van however we have the variable cylinder engine Overall this is a great alternative to the MiniVan
0,My first Corvette was a 1957 that I sold in 1979 to buy my Home I now have a new 2007 Coupe that was worth waiting for It looks and drives just the way I want it to Just enough power to get in trouble with I drive the Corvette to work in good weather Its the best feeling to drive a car that you love even if its just to work Jay Leno said it best if you dont like the interior buy a nice Dinette set
1,I own a 02 Odyssey EXL and a 07 Pilot EXL The family prefers the Odyssey overwhelmingly than the Pilot The Pilot is nice when travelling alone or with the missus The kids I have two constantly complains that it is too cramped and theyre only three and five The Odyssey just provides better value in terms of comfort cargo room and gas mileage The Pilot is the vehicle I use to travel to work On the weekends it is strictly the Odyssey with the family
0,My 07 C6 6 speed auto coupe is now broken in I drive it only in good weather and stow it in winter so every time I use it is a treat Just returned from a 1300mi road trip It is a perfect road car for two Very comfy plenty of passing power when you need to leave the 18wheelers in the dust and stores plenty of luggage golf clubs etc The base version is just great It has all of the creature comforts needed Only problem has been some noise in the rear differential which was corrected by dealer with a TSB recommended additive to the differential lube If I lived in a warmer climate Id use this car as my daily driver Its well made and Im proud to drive the best allAmerican sports car
1,I was a little worried about fuel economy but not any more City driving is about 17 mpg On a trip to FL we averaged 25 mpg One time was 27 mpg between fill ups There is plenty of room Seats are comfortable There is more horsepower than Ill need
0,Love the car Wanted one since I was a kid Montery Red gets loads of compliments Not my everyday drive so everytime I get in its special
1,Nice vehicle that is built on a Civic chassis Yet it lacks the power and guts that the dealer states it haswhich is a total letdown The back seats are very poorit is almost more comfortable sitting plastic seats in the bleachers The back seating is not made for long distance tripsjust trips that are less than a mile long to the local storethink twice about these seats if you care about your guests Where is the power in this vehicleit struggles to pull what it is designed to pull The gas mileage is not was it is stated on this siteit is less more like 13 and 17 Be advised twice before you purchase BTW there is no AWD in this vehiclejust a myth
0,Great super car I have owned 2 Porsches 2 Caddys 6 Marks 1 Infinity 6 Vettes and many others This is the absolutely the best and greatest experience of all Awesome acceleration superb handling good comfort excellent reliability and good gas mileage Its all I expect from a car and its made in America
1,I own this vehicle for 8 months and have over 9000 miles on it At first I was totally surprised at the outrageous fuel consumption getting from 912 MPG in the city The dealership and Honda customer reps kept reassuring me that it will get better as the car gets more miles THEY LIED THE MPG STILL SUCKS Whats worse is that there is nothing you can do about it Car manufacturers get a lot of levity in how they advertise fuel consumption
0,You simply cannot go wrong I have owned 7 Corvettes Every model from C 1 to C6 are beautiful But the ZO6 is simply one of the best cars ever made It has stunning looks and great performance Cannot park or drive it without people commenting on its beauty This car is second to none
1,This truck was a great value There was a  dollar2000 rebate when I bought and no other truck could compete with for features at the price Ive had the truck for a few months 2200 miles The truck drives great and the interior is beautiful big and comfortable The exterior is boxy but not bad The only negative is the MPG I read the reviews and knew it wasnt going to be great I was expecting 1517 mpg I dont drive in the city and I only get 14 MPG
0,Love this car The 07 replaced my 04 which I did not like The features handling automatic roofand the horsepower are the most bang for the buck This car has been a joy to own I drive it to work daily The victory red color turns heads every time Never go anywhere that I dont hear nice car yelled from somewhere The gas mileage is also impressive
1,First off for all of you complaining about the gas mileage youre nuts I have a Dodge Durango and the Pilot There is no comparison whatsoever For the 3k miles we have put on it we are averaging about 21 mpg Now if you have the 4x4 version I can see a decrease But all you others probably just have a lead foot There are only two negatives that I have with the Pilot First the front driver side leg room is not what I would like it to be Second the back door is a pain in the rear to close sometimes I wish they would have made it about 12 a foot longer then a tall guy like me would not have any issues up front If you buy one you will fall in love with it
0,I have owned this vehicle now for a year and have had nothing but a phenomenal experience The car is quiet handles superb and had the power to keep things interesting always I ways amazed at getting 268 mpg on a trip back from Kentucky Great to have an all American Sportscar available that can perform with the best of them The storage in the back is great for road trips No regrets on purchase of my first Corvette
1,I have owned many fine cars including Infiniti Toyota and Mazda This vehicle tops them all Very comfortable in long drives great cargo room and room for 7 easily Great economy for size and easy to maintain Great power when needed and great visibility The only negative and its minor a slight blind spot when checking traffic from the right due to post angle Other than that I rank this SUV as best in class
0,This is my second Corvette The first was a Yellow C5 Coupe It was an awesome car and I loved every day I drove it This White C6 is also a great car I was so enamored with the extra 50hp that I didnt even notice how bad the paddle shifters were until Id had it for a couple months The sixspeed auto is head and shoulders above the fourspeed auto that was in my C5 But forget using the paddles By the time it actually changes gears the moment has passed and you forget you wanted to do something I also preferred the C5s interior I do love lots of the features of the C6 and in fullauto mode its really quick But I think I should have gotten the manual
1,My 1st SUV and probably last since I am a carguy but needed this for family reasons for a few years The airflow over the front fascia is such that every insect within 5 miles will splatter on your windshield Ive had more splats on my windshield in the past 10 months than Ive had in 30 years of driving Windex scouring pads and I have become very close
0,I woke up one day and decided it was time to treat myself to a sports car I went to the dealer and walked out with the Vette 1 hour later This is by far the nicest car I ever drove I was never a Vette person until I got behind the wheel and drove it
1,With 1K miles on it now Im positive I made the right decision getting the Pilot Im not sure why all the negative posts about mileage Its an SUV folks They all get poor mileage but the Pilot is amoung the best in class On a 450 mile trip I averaged 229 mpg cruising at 70 mph My old Grand Cherokee wouldnt even come close with its antiquated inline 6 I bought this with gas prices over  dollar3 per gallon knowing full well it wasnt going to be cheap to run For those wanting better mileage get a Civic We were only considering Subaru  Toyota  Honda SUVs when we were shopping The Honda had the best combination of features vs price point
0,I had owned and enjoyed a 2003 Z06 but the 2007 is basically the same curb weight with 100 more hp The car must be driven with respect for its capabilities I do 23 HPDE events a year with it The coupe design allows a lot of luggage space On a road trip of nearly 2000 miles using the AC over half the time the car got 275 mpg
1,Good so far gas mileage is a little better than expected Even in city driving Maybe the cylinder management helps
0,This is my 5th Corvette and while everyone buys a Corvette for performance this one has a great ride and gets excellent mileage Its one year old and nearly perfect from all points of view Museum pickup is highly recommended for the experience and perhaps better quality assurance as they thoroughly check out the vehicle
1,I loved the mileage on my hybrid but I was having a hard time getting in and out and we travel alot now and needed more room Only 2 tanks of gas through it so far first tank combined was 20 mpg The 2nd tank was all city and was a little over 15 mpg I averaged over 40 with my hybrid I love the room and the ride Mileage is much better then the 2002 Dodge Ram 4 door pickup 614 I traded for the hybrid It is quiter than the Civic and much easier to get in and out of I feel safer driving it I did not want 4 WD and the VCM helps with the milage I have owned a lot of vehicals in my 60 plus years and this one is right up there with the best I have owned Thank you Honda
0,This is my first GM product I am a selfdescribed Mustang nut My last vehicle was a 2004 SVT Cobra vert Mystichrome package I have been critical of Vettes since the late 1970s My last Cobra impressed on me again how uninspired contemporary Vettes were Then the Z06 came out After test driving a used 2006 model I was smitten We bought our Z06 on June 30 2007 I am convinced and converted from Ford faithfulness This is the performance car for under  dollar10000000
1,Im mad at myself that we didnt get this car sooner Its got loads of space performs well in snow and is very comfortable for all passengers on trips both long and short If youve got kids need more space and dont want to be seen in a minivan this car is worthy of your consideration
0,Incredible acceleration Good engine sound handles like a big go cart Nice interior By far the quickest car Ive ever driven and Ive driven some fast ones Reminds me of the song The Best is Yet to Comeyou think youve flown before but babe you aint left the ground
1,I had been planning on a 2007 CRV but decided that I should drive a couple others before making a decision I drove the Pilot and loved the ride and power I knew then that I was kidding myself into thinking I would be OK with the CRV acceleration I picked out an LX I didnt have much need for the extras that came with the EX I prefer the cloth interior and it doesnt bother me to insert another cd when I am done listening to one I am actually more of a talk radio type I do miss the automatic light shutoff I have to wonder why Honda would have that feature on the LX Accord and not on the LX Pilot Exiting the back seat seems clumsy
0,After waiting 40 years to finally get the boyhood dream I purchased an 07 Corvette only to find out the name went on before the quality went as the quality never made it The car is great looking runs great and is fun to drive but the drive components and rear end are junk whenever I turn or start out it is if I were going over bumps in the road I took it back and the dealer simple lubed the rear end this worked until the lube wore and the problem reappeared again On the second trip it was found that a tech bulletin had been generated for the problem and the dealer replaced the friction padsthis didnt cure the problemsI am getting rid of it after this No more American cars for me
1,Having a Honda minivan we thought that the Pilot would be a nobrainer purchase We were wrong The mileage is so far off on this SUV that its criminal I dont think I broke 1112 mpg on the highway going 5560 without any cargo or other passengers The engine is underpowered if you are driving a vehicle that actually contains passengers The interior is nice the sound system is good and all the guages are nicely layed out The car comes with very little coverage which is why Honda Care is so strongly encouraged After putting some miles on I am beginning to hear a lot creaking
0,The first time I drove my ZO6 Corvette i could not get over the extreme acceleration braking and handling the ZO6 produces The comfort and beauty of this precision machine is definetely and finally considered in my book a super sports car Way to go Chevy
1,The gas mileage is horrible I get 13 miles to galnot a lead foot There is a clunking noise in the rear of the car always think I have run over something coworker has same model and same problem dealer states nothing wrong The build feels cheap Engine is quiet has good powerDrivers seat is postioned funny to the steering wheel cannot explain this correctlytry to put your knee on the steeing wheel Gas and brake pedal are in weird position also Cannot wait to trade this vehicle Cannot use all speakers due to vibration makes sound terribleHad Toyota Highlander V6 and it was totaled not by megas mileage was 18 in city and saved my lifeWaiting for 08 Highlander to buy
0,The new Corvette Z06 is the fastest car I have ever driven Its heart stopping acceleration is astonishing I found that the 6 speed gear box feel like it belongs in a truck The clutch is also very hard to push and you will get a sore leg after awhile OtherwiseI loveit The exhaust sounds like the good old American muscle that I have been used to Awesome brakes handling is great and most of all great engine The car turns heads because of its awsome design My car is victory red Red looks the best on this car Fun car to drive There is no car on the road that even think of racing you and your car you look at them and laugh The best thing ispower
1,Purchased Pilot March 4 2007 Getting between 1316 MPG Have 1500 miles on it Carpool friend has a 2005 Pilot also 4WD and same engine size They get 17  22 MPG and have from day 1 We have the same commute What has changed I agree with other reviews  needs auto locking doors rear door should auto lock if not closed hard enough Temperature gauge should be on mirror not behind steering wheel
0,Picked up the 3LT with Z51 performance This car is a pride and joy to own Great curves aggressive appeal and is a real head turner Putting the pedal to the floor provides a thrill of excitement and gets the heart racing Traded in an 06 350Z Roadster with a few after market performance parts and without a doubt the Vette blows it away in avery aspect of power ride handling looks and technology Not even sure why I bought the Z in the first place Took a beating on the trade but well worth it
1,This car is totally horrible on gas Any decent features are totally overshadowed by its hunger for gasoline Honda told me a bunch of lies about how the fuel consumption will improve but I drove it for 3000 miles and dont see any improvements For the curious I get on average 1011 MPG and thats both city and highway driving
0,My black ext 2tone red int 6speed Vette has impressed me since the day I bought it Im trying to not get a speeding ticket within the first 1k miles Fast 0  60 in the blink of an eye What other 400 hp V8 can get 28 mpg highway and 18 mpg city This 07 Vette is handsdown a great car Great ride and great handling with the Z51 package A lot of nice options with the 3LT especially the HUD with a G meter I receive compliments every where I go Thanks to Chevy for a real American made sports car
1,Feels more powerful than a v6 Mpg slightly less than advertised Pleny of room for 5 Front cup holders awkward to reach Some road noise but should be expected w suv
0,Great overall car I was suprised that I could get over 20 miles a gallon on the interstate even while putting the pedal to the floor every once in a while only runs about 1500 rpms going 90 miles per hour Very responsive steering Great stereo stock
1,Very little power and not enough joy in driving the vehicle way too much money for the fit and finish of it when you really look at it up close
0,Have had the Corvette a short time but can truly say it is one of the best cars I have owned Very agile handlingpower when you need it and very comfortable car The ride is very smooth even though it is a sports car but it can handle the curves like it is on rails If you want a sports car that can be used everyday this is the one or keep it as a weekend car The fit and finish is very good All gauges are at hand with no reaching With the large back window and excellent mirrors visibility is very good This car is a keeper
1,This car STINKS The worst thing about it is gas consumption I get from 8 to 11 MPG even though the sticker advertized 17 to 22 MPG The car rattles the body is weak
0,When I drove this car into work for the first time my collegues thought I had won the lottery or sold a kidney Most people thought this car should have costed well over  dollar100k when I paid less than  dollar50k for a fully loaded variety The fact that it stands out more and severly outperforms a BMW Z4 Mercedes Benz SLK320 and Porsche Boxter and costs the same or even a little less is astonishing This car is absolutly gorgeous and I cant imagine why anyone else would possibly buy any other sports car in the  dollar50k price range There is nothing that car doesnt have that a  dollar200000 Ferrari does have Car feelslooks incredible and the 5 year warranty gives me great peace of mind
1,I have enjoyed driving my 2007 Honda Ridgeline truck however it has come to lease end and I will be turning it in for a new 2009 Acura TL wTech Pkg I have nothing but praise for the Ridgeline It did have an electrical problem computer chip and electronic board fried within a month after my purchase Also the handles above the right and left rear passenger doors came loose and was about to fall off Weird since I dont ever have passengers back there The service department said that it probably was threaded wrong at the factory Also the back lighting on the heated seat HILO button drivers side kept burning out prematurely
0,Ive wanted a Vette since I first saw the 63 StingRay Purchased my first a C6 VictoryRedBlack coupe with auto6sp paddle shift to replace a Honda S2000 convertible The ttop was a wise choice for me allowing the convertible experience while still allowing a quiet coupe ride and practical storage under the hatch The 400 hp engine and 6sp paddle tranny gives plenty of power and sporty driving experience It doesnt corner like a smaller roadster but is a much better all around vehicle Can store plenty of golf equipment and weekend luggage in the back even with the t top stowed I find the stereo ac basic seats and basic suspension to provide a very comfortable experience
1,Vehicle handles very well on the road accelerates smoothly with 5 speed automatic Displays are very clear steering wheel mounted radio controls nice AC with dual zone works very well Door handles oddly shaped but you get used to them  actually is designed with ergonomics in mind  youll see Rear window slides with push buttom Rear windows go down all the way Rear gate easy to openclose Trunk in the bed water tight and roomy for suitcases medium sized or lots of groceries Rear seat folds up and has plenty of interior holding capacity  does a 3070 split Seats area a little firm so make sure everyone likes that before committing Radio is has static only bad item
0,After a Mazda 626 Nissan Sentra Isuzu IMark 280Z Ford Mustang Toyota Camry LE Odyssey and Azera I was finally able to get my dream car the 2007 Corvette My better half and I thoroughly enjoy the drive especially with the option of the targa during the endless southern CA summers No mechanical problems good gas mileage about 27 mpg highway so far beautiful paint machine silver titanium interior XM radio and paddle shifters in sport mode Wonderful 400HP engine purrs along at highway cruising speeds hardly breathing hard at 1800 rpm then roars to life in an exciting way and eats up the road when presented with a chance to sprint Miles of smiles guaranteed
1,This is supposed to be a truck Everyone raves Motor Trend names it TRUCK of the year and I ordered one It arrived 3 weeks late and its basically a jacked up accord The bed if you can call it that is useless it has low approach angle and scrapes on the most miniscule inclines it has no ground clearance and no torque The passengers rear door didnt close right and I had to take that in to be fixed If this is what Honda considers a TRUCK they are sadly mistaken It will be sold after next April and Ill be looking at Toyota and Ford And looking a LOT more closely than just at Honda Trend Magazine Those guys must be getting bribes
0,I have had my 2007 C6 Coupe with paddle shift for a little over 2 months and have driven about 3300 miles The performance is exceptional Ive owned sedans from BMW 2002 and 535i Infiniti Q45G35x Mercedes 300D and Volvo S70 and sports models from Alfa Romeo And Subaru SVX plus old time muscle cars 66 Impala 396 and 67 Olds 442 The Corvette is by far the most powerful best handling and most fun to drive At  dollar48000 list it is a great value When driving sedately it is as well behaved as a performance sedan When you ask for speed and handling it responds aggressively Plus Ive been averaging a little over 21 mpg Going to Spring Mtn Vette School next week Cant wait
1,This truck is the greatest truck I have ever owned I have owned just about every brand of domestic truck out there and though this is not as heavy duty as some of the domestics it definitely holds its own
0,Miles of smiles Each and every one is so much fun to drive after my C5 its hard to believe Its much improved comfort and style looks say it all
1,This thing does everything most everybody needs to do with a truck I know that it isnt a fullsize truck and didnt expect it to be But I will not own a domestic vehicle because the resale value is way to poor This is the nicest vehicle I have ever had
0,The C5 was good the C6 is superb confident Aston Martins extreme luck in France notwithstanding Corvette competes on a world stage the street cars benefit directly from the race program When its all said and done its a Chevrolet affordable it is a practical twoseater that realizes nearly 30 miles to the gallon on the road
1,Its not the snazziest truck but it delivers Its a honda not a BMW Its runs and runs
0,I really cant believe what a docile driving beast this car is You could easily step out of a Honda Civic and into this car finding it so very similar Easy to drive easy ride quality and refinement Then the tach reaches 3500rpms and the beast is let loose big time I take friends for rides and never do anything outrageous until the end of the ride and they are so surprised how quiet and comfortable it is When they feel the power like me they wonder where it came from so quickly so brutally It is totally up to youdrive carefully and get 27mpg or like Mario Andretti 36 seconds to 60 you can do either with this everyday driver able supercar
1,Used for long 7 hour commute with tools and gear The head rest is kind of a pain in the neck but everything else excels for this class Full size rear passengers prefer my truck over the Dodge ram 4 door Visibility is great and most importantly the rough northern roads I drive on can not kick the rear end out on corners and ruts even when driving on packed snow Around town I have used it to haul 5 yard of gravel also filled the box with bedding sand It handled better than my Silverado did with the same weight but I did have to spend some time washing sand out of the trunk lid seams and double operating tailgate Keeping it around 55 to 60 miles per hour gave me avrg 18 mpg
0,I have only had my car for a few weeks and I find myself wanting to lay on the gas more and more It seems very manageable at lower rpms and really gets up to go when you want it to
1,I purchased this vehicle in late 2005 due to its extensive safety features and fuel economy within the price point I have now put less than 2K miles on it and am ready to sell Why Gas mileage running 1213 mpg rather than the 1621 Blind spots make the vehicle difficult and dangerous to drive for a petite driver Significant blind spots occur in right rear due design and rear headrest configuation The headrest design should be abolished The curvature forward makes it very uncomfortable and many people turn them around defeating the purpose Impossible to judge distance when backing up due to blind spots
0,This car is awesome Its fun to drive civil when cruising and potent when needed or demonstrated not needed A great attention getter people still turn to look A much more civil vehicle than my 1970 454 C3 Coupe but faster and much better handling
1,This is my third Ridgeline My first two were black this one is dark cherry pearl My only wish is that it would get a little better gas milage Everything else is great Ride handling quality build safety color and new mp3 abilityI just love it
0,No other car compares to this Corvette for function style or looks It will run with cars that cost 3 to 7 times as much and do it more comfortably and much more fuel efficient This car sips fuel and runs like a jet
1,Replaced Nissan Frontier with the Honda Ridgeline July 2007 Has many great features plus the reliability of a Honda I dont require a true pick up most of the time so its payload capacity is fine really like an SUV in most respects Gas mileage on hwy is a little disappointing for a V6 engine currently about 20 mpg Honda made a mistake by not using one of their more powerful Acura V6s as this vehicle doesnt have the power or torque required for towing or climbing hills We travel from FL to NC mountains on a regular basis and it works hard to climb the hills If I required a truck to tow anything I would not have purchased the Ridgeline
0,Ive had this car for 2 months and have had zero problems This is my 4th Vette and I thought I loved my 25th anniversary C5  but this one is superior in every way Interior styling is a vast improvement They finally included a decent stereo and power top Im a big guy so getting out is a little difficult  but Ill live with it Plenty of headleg room
1,We just purchased a 2007 RTL with Nav And we had to make a trip from Montana to California the Navigation was great wont buy another vehicle without it Everything is great about this vehicle except for the front seats they are way too hard for long trips we just couldnt get comfortablewe had to buy cushions to put on the seatsHonda Company should consider putting Acura MDX seats in this truck and make the steering column telescopic I had trouble getting close enough for the steering without my knees hitting the dashboard and Im only 55 If those two things were corrected this truck would be a definite 10 all the way
0,Bought this car new in December The car has 200 miles on it and devloped a power steering fluid leak Been back to the dealer twice Dealer replaced power steering rackgear unit and the resivior  still leaking
1,Purchased the Ridgeline in May 07 PROS Inbed locking trunk good handling and great turn radius for a truck extremely comfortable and roomy interior with extra roomy center console decent power from V6 CONS Horrrible gas mileage under suggested sticker terrible blind spots making it very hard to see to your left right or rear base stereo system lacks any mids I have heard better quality from a ham radio seems like you have to gas it to accelerate at a decent pace All in all its a very good vehicle if you dont mind forking out loads of cash for gas or backup or change lanes often Those two issues are enough to have me trading it in this week
0,I had all the Vettes c 15 and and this one will make history If you drive one you will buy one A little hi tech for an everyday driver but so far no problems
1,I had an OJ Simpson 1995 Bronco for a little over 10 years It was reliable drank gasoline like a thirsty boozer and rode like a vehicle from hell re lack of comfort Im retired fly fish pull small boats go off road as well as drive in town and local trips Ride is good The grandkids love to ride in and prefer it over my wifes Lexus The mileage has been a disappointment with an average of about 16 per tank I normally beat the estimated mileage not here The lack or real off road under vehicle protection is a pain Apparently that is due to the Honda lawyers The vehicle hauls everything we have needed to haul The lockable trunk in the bed is great Buy one
0,I have owned many makes of cars from a 260Z to a Cadillac including a couple of Mercedes This is the best riding car I have owned It gets very good gas mileage especially for a 400 hp gorilla I love driving it riding in it looking at it and touching it I have turned the seat heater on and driven a few minutes to relieve back pain It also relieves depression except when one writes the check to pay for it
1,I bought my Ridgeline in July and have not been able to pick up radio stations in my area Dealership has changed antenna modular and the cable Now they are trying the radio I love this truck but not the radio I must have gotten a lemon The best feature is the trunk in the bed
0,This is my seventh Corvette and hands down it is the best one yet Performance is off the scale but it is also docile enough to be your driver See you on Route 66
1,Ive had my Ridgeline for 7 months now and put around 7500 miles on it I traded a 2004 Acura TL on this truck due to a change in commute requiring AWD in the Winter I never thought Id be a truck person and to be honest the looks are not my favorite but you cant argue with the total package This is the safest thing out there in the Winter in terms of AWD airbags stability control traction control It did really well last year during our late Winter storms Fuel economy got better once broke in It went from 15 to 17 around town for me I have a mixed commute of about 24 miles including 5 miles on a mountainous road and Im averaging around 185 MPG Not bad for a truck
0,Great exhaust sound Excellent seats Smooth clutch The heads up display hud is great
1,I traded in my 2003 Infinity G35 sedan for the deluxe Ridgeline While the interior design doesnt measure up to the Infinity it sure beats the pants off all other trucks I checked out The charcoal grey metalic is the best color option The only beef I have with the exterior is the omission of side door protectors and rails both after market or dealer added options I get 17 cityhighway and 20 highway MPG with regular unleaded not bad for a 4600lb truck I also added an after market bed protector and under rear seat mat I might add that there is planty of storage in the cab including a huge space between the front seats
0,Decided to buy the base model because it is more comfortable and actually faster with six speed Luxury or high performance at the blip of a throttle C6 is much better than C5 and the build quality is fantastic First trip 25mph and now 19 in citywow I like the fact that base wheels are easier to clean and look great at all angles This is the most surprising vehicle I have ever owned and I have had them all Porsche MB etc 400 horsepower sure makes smiles happen quickly
1,I shopped around for the truck with the best fuel mileage rating In Canada it may be different but the rating the Ridgeline had was 28 miles to the Gallon The Tacoma was 27 Between these two I preferred the Honda as it had more available options that I was Looking for ie loaded Unfortunately I have yet to do better than 22 and as last winter progressed I did many tanks at 165 miles to the gallon The mileage just isnt their a major disappointment I believe the vehicle is underpowered for its size with a 35 l engine The Tacoma with its 40 gets better mileage and better power If I had it to do over I would have gone with the Tacoma
0,It is absolutly the greatest experience in the world for me to be able to own and drive the only hand built American sports car left Its style comfort and yes even economy is just out of this world Thanks Chevrolet for building a sports car that is above the rest
1,Great Truck Very well designed comes with almost everything youll ever need in a vehicle It drives like a champ I live in Alaska where roads are rough and icy in the winters The AWD system works great It delivers great traction on slick icy roads
0,This is my 10th Corvette and General Motors finally has done it No more water washes the speakers when you open the trunk That problem power antenna is gone And every thing I used to have to add on is already there Ie Nice stereo thats loud enough and amplifiers amd mp3 This has it all and its darn nice
1,I have owned every truck brand sold in America and the Ridgeline hands down is the best driving truck I have had The roads here are rough and slick in winter and this truck handles excellent on icy snowy roads The back end stays stable and it stops on a dime without even changing to all winter tires I agree this isnt a brute to take out on bad dirt roads but for occasional truck needs and an everyday commuter this is an excellent choice in all winter conditions Alaska has thrown at it
0,This is my first Corvette and Im very impressed I looked at several cars and the Corvette in my opinion is the best value for the money Its fun to drive and reliable Impressive acceleration surprisingly smooth ride comfortableroomy interior and great design I strongly recommend this car
1,i normally drive a Chevie tahoe this vehicle gets the same fuel economy on the highway and worse in the mountains It is very rough riding It is much noisier Its turning radius is terrible I pulled a trailer and got 9 miles per gallon I am trying to get rid of it and it has less than 5000 miles I bought it because of the size and storage With 240 plus horsepower I thought it would be better for passing
0,Updated All American look returns Light years better in most depts than C4C5s Well balanced design performance and handling If theyd only cure RF tire noise on concrete freeways Retains a hint of earlier crude front suspension feedback on rough streets Needs a hair more suspension travel Good interior styling and almost quality look GM had to include a cheesy painted plastic panel on forward console and climateradio controls Ltd leg room for over 6 2 drivers needs 3 more inches there 6 spd auto allows broad power choice just keep revs over 2K After 6K mi Ive noticed occasional clunks shifting into R and occ sloppyslow shifting in D or S Must be the DBW
1,Have had the car for nearly a year now and the driving experience has been great BUT now for the warning The S2000s seats and parts for that matter are hot parts with young kids souping up their little cars My car was completely stripped seats steering wheel radio airbags and carpet right in front of my own house If you are to purchase this car make sure you have a garage or a very good aftermarket alarm If not stay clear of the car I now have an alarm but I still have that fear of someone stripping it again
0,This is a great car An amazing ride One of the best Vettes yet The sleek interior design and ultimate performance makes it one of the best
1,I have lusted over the Honda S2000 ever since it arrived on the scene I have had a 91 Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce and a 96 Mazda Miata I love my new convertible except on the freeway Driving above 60 mph scares me and I feel like Im going to lose control of the vehicle around freeway bends There is major fishtailing involved and I oftentimes struggle to regain control of the vehicle if I am driving anywhere over 60 mph In Texas driving less than 70 mph on the freeway is a death sentence
0,I rarely drive my Corvette daily but I drive it on the weekends around the city The driving experience is absolutely refreshing because the engine has so much torque available at any speed The seats are comfortable along with the close proximity of the user controls which make drving the car more pleasureble The most impressive feat of the Corvette is its ability to give very good highway miles per gallons in parallel with an engine that put creates 400HP I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a solid Amreicanmade sports car
1,I owned a 2003 and the 2007 has a little more giddyup and better audio My opinion hasent changed since 2003 You wont find a better fun car at under  dollar35G This car will handle itself rather well against any car Ive come across except for the Corvette However in a series of S turns the Vet couldnt keep up Its insane how the S2000 handles all styles of cornering I know the tires have a lot to do with it but still
0,This is my first performance car and I must say I am impressed Everything about is so well built and designed GM really takes pride in their Corvettes The best part is how versitile this car is comfortable yet functional fast but controlable I have the Z51 suspension and I have taken turns at 3X the speed limit with the car still holding stong Though it can be driven year round if you live in the northern climates like I Id recomend a winter beater The run flats get very slippery in colder temps I have not driven the car in rain or snow but im told it holds its own The car has just amazing If you can buy one
1,Owned many cars over the years several being of the sports variety This car smokes The only bad point if you could call it that is everyone that sees you wants to race Their mistake this car eats everything alive
0,For the money these cars cost they provide an incredible value for the performance car buyer It has amazing acceleration corners like it is on rails gets 30MPG on the highway has no rattles or squeeks has great visual impact has a very comfortable ride and seats lots of geewhiz technology like a head up display and is just a very rock solid car
1,This vehicle will not run with a Corvette so do not even try However with that being said there is no other like it The S2K is in a class all by itself when handling and looks are considered The S2K is typical Honda quality with a fairly good amount of Hondas racing heritage mixed in The 22L VTec doesnt produce a lot of low end torque but above 6K on the tachometer you better hold on I recently had the chance to trade for a 2007 Boxster S and I just could not bring myself to do it I love this car
0,This is the fastest stock production car I have ever driven off the vendor lot and the most fun I have had Porsches Ferarri and various old muscle cars which just do not compare to the overall power plus daily fun to drive performance of this car I keep reading about plastics cheap interior doesnt compare to Porsches Ferarris Lambos etc Give me a break Its half the price or less There is no other car I have owned which comes close to what this car can do for the money spent This really is the car with the best bang for the buck I would purchase another if I did not have to wait another 10 months again just to pay premium over MRSP
1,Hands down the hottest roadster on the market Classic lines great performance Honda quality Sorry to all my s2k colleaguesnothing beats Black on Black
0,Just bought this car 2 months ago and now have 800 miles This car is everything you have read about it Excellent performance accleration comfort and economical for a sports car Name another 400hp car that gets 28 mpg on the highway 060 in under 5 seconds and is very comfortable as a daily driver and on the highway Monterey Red with cashmere interior and polished aluminun wheels looks great I got the 6speed which is a blast to drive XM radio with Bose stereo sound great as well Rear luggage can easily stow 2 sets of golf clubs with room for the removable top Very quiet on the highway on most surfaces The run flat tires are a bit noisy on concrete
1,I bought the base model 5 speed with AC and have generally been pleased with the car I suggest buying an automatic because the trans is covered under the 10 yr 10000 mile warranty the clutch is not Mileage in town 24 27 and 3133 on highway I highly recommend grabbing a new one as opposed to a used one with low miles the 2009s have a rebate and you also get the 10 year warrantywith used you only get 5 Also used are hard to find and factoring in the rebate you dont save that much in purchase price My family has owned 8 Hyundais new and preowned
0,This is the 23rd Corvette I have owned I did not trade my Red 2002 Z06 as it only has 6000 miles on it since I bought it new I like the old hardtop style and I wish the 2007 had the same roofline as the 02 The 07 is way smoother to drive and does not show any kind of raw power until you want it to I have never had a Corvette like this one A real sleeper My wife would never know what it was capable of It is a pure rocket ship but much more predictable than the 02 which is a twitchy ride The new one is so different its hard to describe Awesome sound system and navigation system Rides and steers like its on railroad tracks and stops instantly The raw pulling power is brutal
1,Airbags failed to deploy in a collision traveling at 55 mph and then hitting an embankment as well Read NHTSA and other consumer complaints regarding this problem with the Accent and other Hyundais and dont find out the hard way We were very fortunate and everyone walked away from this death trap Other prior problems include cheap tires from manufacturer that manufacturer and dealership did nothing to correct  referred to tire maker who said they didnt care about the complaint  no exaggeration And of course car is very uncomfortable
0,Have less than 300 miles on it so far Love it just as much as my 1981 Corvette I owned many years ago
1,I feel swindled by the Hyundai people Things started off without any real problems Never had an accident and I always tried to keepup with any maintenance Sadly after 30000 miles my catalytic converter is destroyed Ive had serious ignition problems and theyve had to replace the spark plugs like clockwork Just traded that sucker in
0,Owned a 1993 Corvette and I really liked it The ride was a little harsh but it was fun to drive I never liked the style after 1996 When the C6 cam out I went to look at them and I liked the style and the horsepowerThe interior was betterwith better design After 2 years of research I decided to buy my 2007 Corvette I glad that I did After owning it 5 months I feel that I can say that the ride is smoothits like driving a regular car The only options that I order were the chrome wheels3LTautomatic trans and monterey red If you really enjoy a well built and fast sports car this is it Make sure you take it for a test ride before purchasing 
1,I bought this car for the gas mileage About a week after I bought it I noticed the Tach doesnt work when its cold The dealership cannot find anything wrong with the tach About a year after I had it the AIR BAG light came on and I had the module replaced now I have around 23000 miles on it and the battery is shot Gas mileage right now is around 23MPGs When the brake fluid is cold dont touch the brakes They get really touchy and can cause whiplash It is sluggish going up hills of any size or when more than one person is in the car I would recommend to everyone not to buy this vehicle As soon as I can get rid of it I am
0,I have owned 8 Vettes over the years and this is the hottest yet It is improved compared with my 04 I was not sure if I would like the headlight treatment but now think it was an improvement The car is quick nimble and a joy to drive
1,Girls dig the style they even say is cutenice firm seats great AC look twice before changing lanes for acceleration is non existing Gas mileage after 21000 miles is about 22mpg Needed battery after 14000 miles Plastic inside scratches easily
0,I was not until recently a big Corvette fan But I have changed my mind after owning the Z06 for the last month It is the fastest car I have ever driven even faster than the Lamborghini Gallardo  dollar200gs a friend brought by to compare to the Z06 The handling is superb and for normal driving it is very comfortable Everything about the car says quality Large multipiston brakes advanced electronic traction control design and attention to detail The Goodyear Eagle Runflats stick to the road like they are part of it The gearbox seems a little heavy but I havent missed a shift and the throw is short and fast I have never had a car that attracts so much attention A great car
1,Overall a decent sporty car for the money with plenty of standard features for the price and great economy however some switches headlights still feel cheap and the engine is downright asthmatic with the ac on which in Arizona is a lot Youll find a lot of people riding your tail after green lights while you get up to speed Drivers armrest on door is rock hard what were they thinking I cant even bear to put my weight on it because it hurts my elbow Shifter is slow and balky B  andM shifter yeah right from their spare parts bin maybe Love the styling the SE rims really add a wonderful sporty look to the car get the SE if you can it totally transforms the look of the car
0,Picked the car up two days ago replacing my 03 Z06 that I thought couldnt be matched This car is far beyond words The power is absolutely intoxicatingand its stance is without equal Sure I couldve bought a Porsche or Ferrari If I had I really would have hated to get spanked by a dude in his Z06 Thankfully I get to avoid that distasteful experience and do the spanking myself This is definitely the Heartbeat of America
1,Had it since 807 Within a week my interior dome light broke had to replace all the tires TWICE gas mileage isnt as great as they sayi have to fill up AT LEAST twice a week if not more I have 50000 miles on it and it overheats bad and its in the shop getting a new Head gasketughTrading it in as SOON as i can
0,What a nice car overall The build quality is on par with my wifes MB SLK Interior could be a little nicer as theres too much plastic I ordered the magnetic suspension which should be on all these The satellite nav is a must as it adds a touch of luxury to an otherwise plainjane dashboard GM really needs to fix this on a  dollar65K car
1,I bought my car in 2007 I have had problems from the beginning I just wanted to know if anyone else out there has had problems with the car not starting after making a few stops around town I turn the key but nothing happens It is almost like the battery is dead but everything else works After I try for a while the car finally starts I took it to the dealer but they cannot seem to find anything wrong with the car I am very frustrated with the situation I was stuck in a parking lot for over a half hour  I have finally decided to let them keep the car until they can find what is wrong with it I am very interested in knowing if anyone else is experiencing this same problem
0,I was never a Corvette fan until the arrival of the C6 The new covered head lights and smaller cleaner looks caught my eye along with a more reasonable price tag than other cars I was considering I could not be more happy with this car It rides better than my friends Carrera S at half the price The engine pulls from a 1000 rpms in any gear Phenomenol braking and superb handling and it looks right at home next to Gallardos and F430s The overall fun for the money factor of this car is unequaled America has arrived at the party This vehicle is finally a world class competitor in the sports car arena
1,Your advertised m P G on sales sticker and email of 33 mpg is wrong My wife averages 205 mpg around town at average speed of 45 mph shopping locally round trip 10 miles 3 or 4 times per week Have car tested
0,I traded my C5 convertible for a C6 coupe after a visit to the assembly plant in Bowling Green We saw the plant on Monday I was behind the wheel Tuesday afternoon The ride is improved over the C5 which was pretty good already Apply throttle and prepare to launch The controls are easy to use Fit and finish are impressive We bought every option possible and enjoy each one of them My hardest decision each day is to pick between the painted roof or the tinted one What the heck some days we go topless
1,This is the worst car I have ever owned I had to have the engine replaced 4 months after buying it brand new and I need new tires already also The wheel shakes incredibly bad when driving at highway speeds making it nearly impossible to control the wheel when driving on the highway Extremely unsafe car Ive filed for the lemon law
0,Quieter and tighter than our 03 anniversary convertible Excellent fuel mileage I like driving the 03 better than the 07 The 07 was a replacement for my wifes 03 Mini Cooper She really liked the 03 so bought her an 07 which she really loves The navigaton system is worth every penny as is XM radio We like the upgraded twotone leather All we can say is we own two and would buy another in a minute We bought the 07 because our 03 has been totally problem free We are very satisfied owners
1,I bought my GS Accent NEARLY new It was 6 months old with about 10k miles It is the bare bones model no AC not even a radio I only paid  dollar7500 for it though For the money its as good as they come I made a few upgrades put in a stereo it had speakers go figure tinted the windows put some 16 alloys on it and presto Its a sweet little ride It has significantly more power than my 2001 Honda Civic but the gas mileage is not nearly as good as my Civic They really should throw a 6th gear on the MT as the RPMs are 4k at 80 MPH This might help with gas mileage too I can accelerate up a hill in 5th gear which tells me it needs a 6th Quality is comparable to the 01 Civic
0,The car is the best Vette I have ever owned There is not one thing I would change except I would like to be able to purchase the Z06 as a rag top my perfect Corvette I bought it to drive and I drive it daily A world class sports car is here and it is a great value for the price
1,Great little commuter My wife loves the way it handles Only problems no cruise needs more power
0,Just picked up my 2007 C6 and could not be happier Excellent performance and ride quality I was impressed that the car rides smooth and comfortable for a sports car The 2007 C6 is fun to drive and is responsive With 400 HP excellent design and improved interior the 2007 C6 is the best dollar value for those interested in making a serious sports car purchase The vehicle continues to impress me every time I drive it When purchasing this vehicle I would suggest purchasing the 3LT and Z51 Packages to enhance ride quality and performance Excellent sports car you wont be dissappointed and wait to you hit the open road
1,My husband and I purchased our Hyudai Accent GLS 4 door sedan right after the Labor Day Holiday We have now had it for about six weeks and put about 1300 miles on it Although we have not taken it out of the city yet we have done both city driving and interstate driving The Accent handles well is a bit slow does ride almost like a small car but not bad It takes curves well and parks easily The sound system is nice and there are neat features which surprising are normally found on higher end cars like lighted mirrors trunk glove box tilt wheel The only interior design we do not like is the placement of the cup holders They should be more up front We are plaesed with our Accent
0,This is my 6th Vette including 3 C6s in the last 2 years My Vettes have always been my daily driver I have owned Porches Infinity Lincoln Cadillac and other find automobiles during my forty plus years of car ownership This is the most exciting auto experience of all my dealings The performance is unbelievable The reliably of my last four Vettes has been perfect with absolutely not one warranty issue and zero for this one now in its second month and 2200 miles A perfect and most rewarding experience
1,This is a neat little car I got a base GS with AC and the upgraded stereo as the ONLY options First time I have had crank windows and manual locks since college The AC blows COLD in the sticky MN summers and the stereo is great Its a peppy little city car and it eats up the miles on the freeway with ease Noisy above 3500 RPM Takes bumps well for a little car too Top gear acceleration with the AC on takes a little planning but I knew what I was getting when I bought it Driving with the drivers window down on the freeway results in amazingly little turbulence First tank resulted in about 30 mpg in combined driving  looking for more once broken in
0,The car is just awesome Great acceleration I havent received numerous positive comments in the one month that I have owned the car LeMans Blue Cashmere Interior 3LT not a cheap option but it does have numerous aspects included and polished aluminum wheels The wheels really set the car off It is beautiful Good ride Not a daily driver for me but it could be used for such Great mileage for a 400HP car Just a truly fun car to drive I looked at numerous options including Porsche Boxster and Honda 2000 before deciding on the Corvette No regrets on my choice I have had the car for almost 4 weeks and 600 miles Great car
1,The car is slow slow slow Its actually average for its class but if youre moving from any recent midsize sedan to this be prepared to step hard on the accelerator Having said that this car is a blast to drive around town You feel like Mario Andretti as you are weaving in and out of traffic You can pull a U turn almost anywhere and sightlines are excellent The brakes are also top notch stopping fast and with good pedal feel I didnt get great gas mileage on my first tank but Im on my second tank and am expecting 30 mpg in entirely city driving The only complaint I have is with the hard plastic doors They arent comfortable and scratch easily
0,I picked up the car and drove it 350 miles back home I was very suprised how quiet and comfortable the car was The performance is out of this world The car pulls so hard and builds speed so quickly It has a suprisingly comfortable ride I have owned many sports cars and this not only was the greatest value but the greatest all around car
1,I like my car but if I knew then what I know now I may not have bought it Keeping in mind that this is an entry level car they could have added a 6th gear to the tranny This is a really loud car when driven at US highway speeds 6575mph and Im not talking about the exhaust notes The engine spins at 35004000rpms at these speeds and makes sure you know it A little sound baffling under the hood and on the firewall would make it a better car to ride in I still feel that Hyundai offers the best value for your dollar but I would have paid a little more for a little less engine rpm
0,C6 3LT chrome wheels paddle shift Monterey red Nav Life is good The interior and exterior are excellent Build quality is much better than I had expected from previous reviews Got the cashmere interior and Lloyd floor and trunk mats After 40 years 65 Stingray and a couple dozen new cars it is good to be back in a Corvette that drives and rides as good as my last Lexus LS430 and prior to that SC430 Speed style and comfort
1,I have had my Accent Hatchback for one week so far Do not like the plastic doors Too easy to scratch What were they thinking Radio only partially worked dealer had to order me another one no biggie Fuel economy on the second tank of gas not living up to its hype I will give it a month and see what happens If my Hyundai does not impress me in the first year I will not buy another one Too much to choose from that are just like it
0,Absolutely the best bang for your buck Considering the fact its competetion are thousands away Porsche and Dodge are still great cars but for all it is worth the Vette Z06 is the true American Sports Car A legend still adding rights
1,I am very happy with the performance but inside door panels should not been made from plastic bcs when the buckle of the seat belts hit those panels scratches occurs This gives an ugly look to those plastic panels like 06 accents panels should be covered by cloth or something else
0,I was looking for a small SUV for quite awhile I had my mind set on a Mitsubishi Outlander but during my test drives I tried a 2006 Equinox and was impressed with the handling I disliked the interior of the 2006 so I tried the 2007 I was impressed with the interior upgrades new for that year and the  dollar was right The cabin is extremely quiet the engine 34 V6 is adequate for size of the vehicle The steering does feel somewhat numbit wasnt a deal breaker for me The back seat is VERY roomy and slides back   and forth  convenient for parents with little ones or if you need additional cargo room without putting the seats down I feel I got alot for my  dollar  so far
1,I am 6ft 230 and have a large build Test drove the Yaris Yeah its a toy but no i didnt fit Next was the kia LOL nonono again Then i test drove a accent and VAROOOM VROOM  Fast Styling Sounds Stick And i havent put gas in sice i bought and have drove 200 miles already From Cheerleader to Football players this car would suit anybodys needs I love driving it and like the attention i get from it its good times for sure Just say Yes to Accent and no To overpriced Yaris Only thing i would change is damn cant think of nothing 
0,I purchased this car after driving a Focus for 9 years I had it for 5 days and then it rained I thought I WAS IN A BATHTUB It has been at the dealer for over a week waiting for parts to come in I think I know why I got such a good deal Hopefully it floats
1,Ive had the car for almost a month now and have driven 700 miles With about 80 percent of my driving being on the highway Ive averaged about 1719 MPG Im a recent college grad and saved most of my money specifically for this car so obviously my disappointment level is high so far Although Ive heard that the breakin period is anywhere between 1500 and 5000 miles so Im hoping it gets dramatically better However this is a beautiful looking car The interior is spacious and you dont feel cramped at all It would be the perfect car if only the MPG was anything close to what is advertised I keep the car around 55 or lower so that cant be the reason for the poor MPG
0,We bought it because our family was growing and we needed a little extra room for the family car Weve been really pleased with how well its done so far We recently took a roadtrip to the mountains and I averaged 28 MPG with the AC on Usually I get 2122 in the city Just a few downsides So far we are pleased with the purchase
1,This is one fine little car that does everything that I ask of it Its not a drag racer but it gets up to speed in a deceivingly smooth manner It will cruise nicely on the freeways at 70 and is agile in city traffic Its size makes it easier to find parking a space Hyundai packed a lot of room inside this coupe Every instrument knob and lever is located where the driver expects to find it Gas mileage is excellent as advertised The air conditioning does its job well and road noise is not an issue At about  dollar14K delivered this car is inexpensive but it certainly is not cheap People can look at my little blue Hyundai coupe but they will just have to go find their own
0,The Equinox fits my lifestyle perfectly right now Its very easy to drive and park It has plenty of room for people or gear Tows my boat or trailer Has great traction with the AWD I love it
1,i just bought this 07 gs car a week ago the only one they had black with black interior its an automatici can say becouse i have the 98 accent too gsi that this new 07 is 5 times the car of the 98 i would recommend this to small car buyers in a flash and the warranty yesssssss they are slow getting the accent to the dealers but worth the wait
0,Purchased the LT3 design with all the bells and whistles Traded a blazer for it This vehicle is the most comfortable car Ive ever driven Very spacious You minivan moms out there should consider the Equinox The remote start is the bomb Not to mention the On Star hands free mobile phone feature A definite recommendation for those looking to buy
1,We were so excited to own our Azera until the tires went bad We had only had the car a few months It became very noisy The ride is bumpy Then the rear visor would get stuck and make the most atrocious noise The handles fell off the dash cracked The battery repeatedly died for no apparent reason The trunk is awful It was poorly designed and rain water falls in and wets all my paper documents inside Ill buy a Honda or Toyota next time
0,I purchased this vehicle 1 year ago and it has been great I drove 4200 mile this winter on a road trip and got great mileage 225 overall had more than enough room for all my luggage Christmas gifts and a chair that I delivered along the way Very comfortable ride and it fits my husband with room to spare Minor issue with climate control system fixed by dealer
1,The 2007 Azera appears like a great buy due to the features and warranty However the car seems to be built with cheap questionable parts and design Weve had trouble with door locks airbags and accessories All were under warranty Then the engineer covers under the car actually came off while we were on the highway  huyndia is not covering it So buyer beware
0,I purchased this vehicle used I have had the vehicle a week and it is great I read everything I could before purchasing This is the most confortable ride I have ever been in it is fun to drive In the week since I got it we have had almost 9 inches of snow It handles great I highly recommend this vehicle I cant say enough
1,Awesome car when it comes to horsepower handling and comfort Sketchy when it comes to overall integrity of the car Little rattles everywhere One major metal to metal noise under the car that I can hear through the console that is driving me nuts and my dealer cant seem to hear it Checked a TSB and found that mine had a fix for such a noise but it didnt help it at all My dealer seems lost and now wont agree that there is a noise Taking it to another and it gets fixed or it goes
0,It took some getting used to but the car is very comfortable performs as well as to be expected for an SUV Braking is not as tight at my previous car and the air conditioning is not as cold I like being able to sit high The radio XM is great sound and the memory is a definite highlight But the most impressive is the reminders of fuel and oil changessuper
1,Car is very Nice love the comfort and design and very sporty not very good in snow and paint starting to chip near wheel Wells tires not good in rain or slush or very little snow steering wheel wood grain finish coming off like is chipping
0,This car has been problem free for the last 22 months I have owned it For the price I think there is no better riding small to midsized SUV on the market Ive had gas mileage up to 26 on a mixed driving Quiet and smooth ride The AWD works well on snow and ice It is well worth the 28k I paid Only complaint is no overhead grab bars For those who think GM cant make a car please go out and drive one
1,This is by far the best car I have ever purchased new It reminds me of when Ford said Quality is Job One but lost it Well the quality moved to Hyundai and lives in the Azera
0,Great vehicle for the money Ours is fully loaded and we love it Lots of room and good mileage
1,This is by far the best car I have ever purchased new It reminds me of when Ford said Quality is Job One but lost it Well the quality moved to Hyundai and lives in the Azera
0,May 2008 has just been a year from the purchase of my truck It is great Very roomy in the inside and a lot of lerg room in the back seat Lots of cargo space It doesnt seem that big from the outside but when you get in its big It was enough room for a third row in the back I love my truck and thank God he blessed me with it and it was brand new with 0 miles when I purchased it Its just a gas guzzler to me
1,This car has the look of cars in the  dollar35000 to  dollar45000 price range In handles extremely well and has good acceleration Trunk space is unbelievable
0,This car has really give us the room and quality he says you can only expect in a Chevy Leg room in the back seat is excellent Hes an insurance claims adjuster and the cargo area has on the space he will need for the mounds of paperwork and file systems he has And vacations are easy to load up for in this car I guess you can tell my favorite feature is the room
1,After having CaddysLincolnsAudis and most recently a 2006 Maxima I wanted something different I never gave much thought to Hyundai until I saw the AzeraI went to the dealership on a Saturday morning and after a test drive and an overall review of the Azera Ltd I walked out a new ownerI was somewhat skeptical at first until I drove the vehicle for a while I am really impressed with itThe qualityridehandelingand style is as good if not better than any other car I have owned It has qualitys that you will pay much more for from other manufactures And the safty features endless
0,I bought the car when changing positions to sales from engineering I work for a company that builds lightweight campers and I needed something that would pull up to 3500 The Equinox does a great job and my gas mileage is very impressive It is a great looking vehicle with somewhat futuristic looks and it compliments the unusual campers we build Without having any trailering experience to speak of I have successfully navigated over 10000 miles with ease On one of my trips I left 1130 at night in a storm with 2 of snow already on the ground while towing a 1600 camper The traction control was awesome even through the winding mountainous back roads of Western Pennsylvania
1,Cant say enough about my 07 Azera Limited with Ultimate package Unbelievable in terrible snow storm Denver blizzard My mileage with regular unleaded has been in the 2324 range around town about 2K so far Great power very quiet love the power side folding mirrors for my garage MANY luxury features Its getting comments like very swanky from the parking valets My only regret is that Hyundai had not yet started started delivery of Azeras with XM radio at the time I got mine I understand the ones produced after the first of the year will have that too on top of a great Infinity radio amp and speakers Could not be happier
0,Okay so lets start off by saying I owned a 2002 Dodge Neon before this yuck It was my boyfriends he loved it but wanted bigger so I got a hand me down this cars a year old with a little over 13000 miles on it I love it drives smooth runs great looks great and is better on gas then my Neon was My sister owns one and she loves it My boyfriends co worker has one loves it If your looking for a spacious reliable SUV this is it Excellent buy Its worth every penny I bought it for
1,My family owns 2 other Toyota I did not even consider a Hyundai when I first started looking into purchasing a new car for the family But I did tons and tons of research reading online review sites as well as forums We decided to test the Lexus ES350 Toyota Avalon and the Hyundai Azerawe never considered an american car The Azera turned out to be quite a suprise It is a extremely good car even without considering the low price or long warranty that Hyundai is known for If you factor in the fact that a similarly equipped Avalon is 5K above the price of an Azera we picked the Azera without hesitation I am now an extremely satisfied owner of a Hyundai Azera
0,I had to get a new car when my old one got totaled I knew I wanted a SUV but i didnt know what I found my car I took it on 2 test drives and I fell in love with it I love how high it sits up im short so that makes a big difference When its time to get another vehice it will definitely be looking for another Equinox I also like how well priced they are
1,This is the necest car I have ever owned without the headaches
0,This is a totally underrated and ignored crossover Easily the best vehicle I have ever owned Versatility unmatched by any other competing small SUV The Edmunds review of the Equinox is more favorable than most The highest praise I can give is that very soon our 07 LT will be joined in the garage by an 08 Sport
1,Comute 50 miles to wrok in my Azera was a little scpetical about upgrading from a Sonata I do not miss the Sonata The Azera drives better and has more acceleration than my old 79 Z28 Yes I am that old Even better I work for Toyota and buy Hyndai
0,Looked for a long time before settling on the Nox Thought I wanted a car after driving a 2 WD pickup for 10 years Took the Nox for a spin on a whim one day and was surprised by the ride and how quiet it was Found this one at a rental outlet with 20K on it and Ive put on 2K So far its been reliable and very comfortable on my 25 mile commute There have been a couple of snowy icy days here in CO that I have been very glad to have the AWD it handles great in the snow Not happy with the mileage averaging 20 or so in mixed highwaycity
1,Great quality and performance Dont be fooled by those name brands and pay thousands more for nothing I mean this Azera is good or better than an Avalon or Acura TL even a Lexus
0,We traded in a 2001 Cadillac Deville on our Equinox We love the room you have when you fold down the back seats Great on trips the Pioneer sound system is awesome It is very quick for a six cylinder Handles great and is fun to drive We dont regret giving up Caddy because the Equinox is just as comfortable Last thing the heated seats are a must for the North Central part of the country you will not regret it I would definitly buy another Equinox
1,I never expected to buy a new car and can not hear the radio for road the noise We talked to the dealer about the problem 2 or 3 times Funny they say they have not heard that before We found a talk site on cars and guess what that was one of the biggest complants with the Azera I do not think it is the tires I think it has no insulation or sound deading in the car and also has a bad suspension under the car The bad part is once you buy or lease this car they or done with your concerns Beware David
0,This is my first SUVAWD I looked at the Ford Escape CRV RAV4 and Torrent The Equinox was far better both in looks and in value Way better looking Pretty and sporty The Torrent was nice looking too but what about that name Anyway Equinox is a great car Really comfortable and just feels good on my back and neck and overall posture when Im driving Perfect height to get in   and out of  dont have to climb in like a full size 4x4 or drop down into like a car Had check engine light issues when I first got the car It took three trips to the dealer but they finally got it right  the gas cap was a bad fit so if you have the same issue get that cap checked out right away
1,Some love the suspensionsome hate it Im one of the latter The suspension was good for the first 35K then started to feel wore out Hyundai replaced the shocks and it felt good for another 5K but now back to feeling wore out Hyundai issued a TSB knowing that the shock were crap but the replacement shocks are still crap The suspension is noisy and the car wallows and bounces over less than perfect pavementmakes for an annoying ride Hyundai USA CEO was quoted as saying the Azeras suspension was designed with the Korean market in mind They should have researched US drivers preferences before marketing in US This car has a lot going for it but the suspension is not one of them IMHO
0,Traded a 2002 super charged Grand Prix Miss the power surge   and headsup display but I love this vehicle It drives like a car Wish it would get better mileage but I sit up higher love the handling and really love the drive and design
1,I traded my 2004 Maxima with only 27000 miles for the 2007 Azera limited wultimate package in August 2007 My purchase was based on the features included with the car especially 8 airbags The Azera outshines my old car in everything wanted or desired in an automobile The turning radius is unbelievable compared to my tradein My wife loves the way the Azera handles as I do
0,One of the best values in the industry Not one visit back to dealership for warranty repairs after 6 months Tons of room for family of 4 Last two vehicles have been imports wont go backAs good or better quality with GM and for thousands less Friends own a 2005 and 2006 Equinox neither have had a warranty repair to date Like this vehicle more now than when I bought it
1,I bought my Azera last spring after researching a number of comparable models I chose the Azera because of its Consumer Reports ratings compared to other similar models and the value for all the goodies I wanted My only complaint is that the seats are incredibly uncomfortable I thought the seats would soften up but after a year theyre just not any better I found my MPG got much better after my 15 month tuneup when they did the injector service Im now getting about 2425mpg with close to 2829 if I do nothing but highway driving
0,I rented this car first and then when t went to auction with 16000 miles on it I bought it and its the best driving and handling vehicle ever Including Toyota and Fords Ive had both the 4Runner and the Explorer No comparison I wish I would have invested in the leather seats though for more comfort Im just attracted to the leather and feel its easier to maintain
1,I am getting about 205 mpg in city drivingslow to down shift On mildly rough roads this car is a handful even after the dealer replaced both front shocks I still feel every bump in the road I also own a 2004 Sonata however I am going to get rid of this heap ASAP
0,Forget the over priced Toyota or the Edge with all that windshield glare  I am truly happy to own this Chevy Equinox Love the tinted windows and sunroof I actually like it better now than the day I bought it with some reservations  Those reservations are long gone Zero warranty work needed so far I like a well built dependable ride
1,The instrument panel lighting is so poor in sunlight cant see odometer or trip meter or Cruise set indicator Tires have vibration Poor fuel 23 mpg Transmission does funny things as if it does not want to release when coasting Should have bot another Buick Lesabre 27 mpg over 68000 miles
0,Bought it for my wife and we love it It has a nice ride spacious quiet and looks great we got it loaded in black with 17 shiny rims
1,Good price and lots of goodies for the price Great ride and if you take care of them they will not only turn heads on the higher end vehicles but also keep going for years to come I kept my XG350 and continue to drive it in tandem with my Azera However Hyundai does a poor job in transport Visually inspect any new purchase very closely They are poor when it comes to care after it leaves the plant Deep scratches and sometimes missing clearcoat spots seem to be a problem with Hyundai and the attitude extends to its dealerships
0,Both my husband and I drive approx 600 each week So we each wanted a low cost vehicle with decent gas mileage and comfort We found this in the Equinox so we bought two I traded in my 2005 outback on the two vehicles Although the subaru is a real fun car to drive it was not comfortable The Equinox is comfort almost as fun to drive and gets good gas mileage Id recommend this vehicle for a young family or older folk like me with not so a pliable body but wants the best buy for the money GM has a hit with this vehicle
1,The Azera has a vibration issue related to the 17 Michelin MXV4 tires Michelin dealers wont replace the tires even after 2 dealers found problems with them because they didnt sell them Hyundai wont replace them 300 miles on the second set Two sets vibrateand customer support wont discuss it beyond saying its Michelins problem 17 low profile tires require nylon that remembers the flat after parking especially in cold temps Shipping from Korea really puts a flat spot in them that wont come out with driving Tech bulletins reveal the problem but Hyundai will not resolve it Very poor customer relations from Michelin and Hyundai Demand nonfactory tires before buying
0,I gave up my Pontiac Montana with some hesitation But the purchase of this car was a wonderful choice It rides well it is comfortable and sporty looking I am a plus size woman and the comfort for me is wonderful The only thing is I continue to get confused with the window controls not being on the doors Otherwise a great car for the money
1,I now have 8000 miles on my Azera and have loved every minute of driving Currently showing 265 average MPG People who ride in it can not believe how quiet the engine is and the back seat leg room
0,I have been driving for 40 years and had about as many cars and trucks in that time with this being my first SUV The closest thing I owned previous was a Chevy van with the same engine which is one reason I knew I would like it The engine is powerful yet delivers great mileage for a vehicle of this size Running it hard around a major city shows close to 19 MPG with highway running 7075 mph 24 MPG Thanks to the 5 Speed The ride is what I really enjoy smooth real smooth and quiet I bought it for the Pittsburgh winters and long commute I make into the snow belt north of here plus the space to carry my wifes wheelchair with room left for other passengers which it does with ease
1,Being a Korean I had many cars from Hyundai before comming to US 10 yrs ago This one is the best of all including Avalon I owned in the US Silky ride and super quietness and the reliability also seems to reach the level of other big name brands Let me tell you one thing Some folks even compared this one with Lexus GS but thats actually not a super surprising comparison When I visited Korea last summer I found that the MSRP of Azera GLS Limited edition is not even available is around USD 4k in Korea That said this car actually is not a cheap car at all just provided in low price to get into the US market
0,I recently went out and traded in my Trailblazer SS for a new Equinox and I am very impressed The gas mileage in this thing is phenominal for an SUV thats not a hybrid I travel a lot for work so I have had many chances to get a feel for it and I really like it My wife also likes it The ride is very comfortable and is almost ideal for long trips For those of you who like to ride high but also want good gas mileage and a comfortable ride this is the one for you I wish I would have got the AWD but my gas mileage would have suffered Also 17 rims are very nice a attractive
1,Great car Only things I would fix are simple Trunk lid drips water into trunk when you open after washing or rain Windshield washer devices mounted on hood are distracting car feels top heavy when cornering but have not flipped it yet Actually has too much headroom Im 61 and I have at least 3  of clearance Overall milage is 273 mpg which includes 90  percent highway miles at 70 mph  now have over 24000 miles in 1 year Wheels protrude a bit so junk and rocks etc tend to hit sides of car small mudflaps would help or the design could enclose the wheels better Wiper controls are complicated when you figure it out they are great
0,I just leased a 2007 Equinox LT FWD the end of May I love it So easy to handle very comfortable and great on gas mileage for a V6
1,I was very enamored in the first month but its not so great afterall Two warranty repairs needed in under 9000 miles taking 5 trips to the dealer to fix them Dealer lacked parts for both repairs even though there was a TSB on the second one Dealer did not go the extra mile for me when I needed them to resulting in additional time living with a broken rear sunshade stuck in the up position and a dangerous distraction while driving since the car always tried to lower the sunshade then raise the sunshade when shifting into R and then Da LOUD horrible noise I am going back to Toyota no warranty repairs not even in 110k miles or Mazda no warranty repairs in 45k miles
0,We looked at many SUVs and always came back to the Equinox We purchased an AWD with 3LT pkg With the chrome clad wheels and leather everyone thinks we paid thousands more It is my wifes car and just the right size to get around in She feels very safe and secure in it The AWD worked well in our Minnesota winter and the stability control took over when I tried to spin out We also have a great local dealer
1,I dont see many other Azeras on the road That is very surprising to me Word must not have gotten out about how great of a car this is The interior is spacious and very comfortable The ride is smooth but not floaty It is extremely quiet There are times I need to look at the tach to make sure the engine is running Even at highway speeds things are quiet in the cabin The upgraded Infinity sound system can definitely overcome the quietness It can easily pump out clear sound that you can feel The 38 liter engine has plenty of power to give quick acceleration The auto trans can lag when trying to kick it in to down shift for passing but slipping it into manul shift mode solves this
0,The Chevy Equinox has been a dream come true for our family The interior roominess of this compact SUV was the major selling point for us We love the ride of this vehicle too
1,I am 55 and have been driving for 40 years and have owned countless cars including a 97 Cadillac Eldorado I just traded in our 2004 Sonata for a 2007 Azera Limited with Ultimate Option Group 25 The Azera is the single best value on the market Nothing compares at this price point I shopped and compared everything in the under  dollar40K range from Audi Ford GM Chrysler Benz Toyota Lexus Nissan Lincoln Cadillac etc etc etc Some of the models road a little better some had a little more horsepower some a little better styling but none can put the ridehandling horsepower styling warranty into a package like the Azera and sell it for under  dollar30K
0,Well I purchased this vehicle for my Mother for a Mothers Day gift My Mother wanted this vehicle since 2005 However the 2007 model was the best to buy yet The StabiliTrak is standard on the 2007 model which is great for handling the vehicle on highway ramps and other tight turns My Mother has said that it drives very smoothly and has great handling with the StabiliTrak feature However my Mother has complained about the wide turns and the location of the hand brake Otherwise its a great investment
1,New azera 2007 offers a new class of luxury comfort performance and safety while driving you hear no voice one of the posetive points is the shift trounic gear box and the only negative point is the lack of gps 7 mounthes before buying my 2007 azera  i used to own a 2007 35 xle camry but the the performance was owful  cabin wax noisy seats were not ergonomic  performance of gearbox was odd of course it had some good points like gps but the dvd was awfulIf i was supposed to decide again between camry   and azera i would certaily choose azera again
0,I am a first time SUV owner I test drove the Toyota Rav4 Ford Escape and Honda CVR This was the most car for the money Lots of safety features and the drivers information center is very useful Have had lots of compliments on the style of this vehicle I would recommend it without hesitation
1,Never thought I would own a Hyundai Was about to purchase a Lexus saw the Azera in a parking lot and was hooked Incredible value Have had only one problem The plastic drivetrain cover fell off while doing 80mph on hiway 5 in the middle of nowhere Scared me
0,Traded in a 2004 Nissan Xterra for the 2007 Equinox The Equinox has much more interior room both in the front and rear seat and being over 6 foot tall I was surprised by the rear seat leg room The ride is smooth and comfortable and compares favorably to my Nissan Altima The gas mileage has been as advertised It has so much more get up and go compared to the Xterra
1,have to replace bulbs all the time  20067 miles NEW TRANSMISSION 4 days in the shop wipers replaced numerous times im 61 yrs old owned alot of new cars in my time this is by far the worst read all reviews and research all said best car in class even still they use these terms we all had to laugh at these comments by so called professional as we waited  customer sevice wondering what would be next hey got me out of yard work and to you pros have some integrality then ill get the grass cut 
0,This SUV shouldnt be in a class with the Ford Escape and smaller SUVs Its remarkably spacious it looks great and theres so many options you can get I got the base model added great leather dark tint remote start bluetooth and rims I liked it this way so I would only pay for what I wanted First ever SUV and Im loving it
1,Overall the car is great Excellent mileage though a better engine and tranny could really get u going great for commutelong distance Plenty of leg space For a  dollar12k car you cant go wrong Forget about trading it in after 4 years
0,This SUV shouldnt be in a class with the Ford Escape and smaller SUVs Its remarkably spacious it looks great and theres so many options you can get I got the base model added great leather dark tint remote start bluetooth and rims I liked it this way so I would only pay for what I wanted First ever SUV and Im loving it
1,My used 2007 Hyundai Elantra is ok Its a very practical car but Ive had to replace my air conditioner 3 times in 2 weeks My headlight froze and fell out in a 35 Celsius day in Alberta And Hyundai says its over abuse on the car Plus Ive only had this car for 3 weeks It was a former rental from Avis This car is bad except the looks and fuel economy DO NOT BUY A HYUNDAI ELANTRA
0,Bought this vehicle after test driving the Saturn Vue It has more interior space and looks better This SUV rides excellent as we just got back from a trip from SC to Florida where we got 25 mpg on the highway and are getting about 215 combined This car handles very well and my wife loves it
1,I never thought I would buy an Elantra but this car won me over The combination of sportiness quiet cabin spaciousness and very sharp interior and exterior made me walk away from the Camry and the Sentra I still cant believe what a comfy ride I own
0,This SUV is fun to drive Came out of a Ford Escape XLT 30 liter lease and was looking at another one when we test drove the Equinox to the Ford Dealer My wife drives this 99 percent of the time She fell in love with this SUV Did a ton of research on the Equinox and got great feedback from others who have them Saved some money by going with front wheel drive only as I was told it is good in the snow and has been in one snow storm and one ice storm I drove it for about 25 hours before purchase and liked the ride and less interior road noise then the Escape One bad note wife said brakes felt weird Took it to dealer and rotors needed to be replaced along with new transmitter fobs
1,I also purchased a 2007 Elantra on 2192007 and within 2 days I noticed that vehicles even UHauls were passing me so to stay with traffic the speedometer was showing 85mph on the Interstate I purposely drove by a stationary radar unit in a 45mph zone going with the flow of traffic the radar indicated 45mph speedometer indicated 55mph I contacted the Service Manager at the Dealer and he said that he is having alot of complaints about this and that I should bring it in so he could get the part number off the speedometer so they could order a new cluster
0,I like the Chevy Equinox We looked for a croosover for a few months We came close to purchasing a Jeep Compass but a friend who had purchased a 2006 Equinox turned me on to the idea of purchasing one I am glad we got the Equinox since it sits 4 inches higher than a Compass If you are looking for an American made crossover then this is one to get It has a smooth ride with lots of power I recommend the LT over the LS as GM put a lot of plastic into the interior But plastic is easy to clean and cheap to replace
1,PLEASE be careful when purchasing this vehicle I am a longtime Hyundai owner previously owning a Sonata I recently purchase a brand new 2007 Elantra I have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it A week after the purchase the transmission was acting up jerking and stalling The service department said it was a manufacturing defect in the seal A week later now STILL having major transmission problems and still stalling Also the left turn signal wont cancel and the service department said it worked find I am truly disappointed in this vehicle and regret buying another Hyundai
0,The Equinox is a fun fuel efficient SUV Not only does it look great it handles well in bad weather and it has a nice weight to it The power window switches are in the center console which would be the only design I would change Overall it is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone purchasing an SUV for the first time
1,This is my 3rd new Hyundai Elantra I have purchsedalso 2000 GLS and 2003 GT We still have the 2003 and it has not given us ANY trouble 82000 miles My new 2007 GLS with the 5 speed manual is more than I expected I got combined cityhighway mpg of 29 the numbers do not lie The car seems so much larger than my 03 It handles and rides like a dream Other than getting some rims and the windows tinted I can not think of anything I would do to my new car Hyundai is on par with any Civic and smokes the Corolla If you do not test drive a Hyundai during your car search then you are doing your self an injustice
0,The Equinox is a fun fuel efficient SUV Not only does it look great it handles well in bad weather and it has a nice weight to it The power window switches are in the center console which would be the only design I would change Overall it is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone purchasing an SUV for the first time
1,Bought the car in jan 2007 it has 1500 kms and I am wondering if the car has front suspension at all Very noisy in irregular road the front tren and the direction are causing knockings I am not very happy withfeels like driving a 100000 kms used car Further the audio is poor and in the highway very noisy  wind 
0,Bought this 2007 as an extra car I am really pleased with the purchase This Chevrolet is well engineered and very quiet and comfortable The engine torque is down low which makes city driving enjoyable Good value for the money in my opinion
1,After looking at the Mazda 3 Civic and Corolla we went with the Elantra The interior size ride and features available with the Limited could not be met by the other three Closest was the Mazda but it was smaller and the Corola and Civic didnt offer leather and heated seats which have been greatly appreciated Add in the outstanding warranty and safety features and it became obvious to us which was the car of preference
0,The ride is very smooth It is a real SUV not like some car based crossovers Engine is just right fast acceleration The interior is improved a lot comparing to previous Equinox
1,This is a great car I have reviewed Sentra Corolla and Civic But I came to buy Elantra for its value overall I bought 07 Elantra GLS  Preferred Package  Automatic for only  dollar13000 The other cars dont even come close to that price The car is well made and its safety features are far above the competitors The car drives well it is comfortable it is roomy bigger than my old Galant 98 My wife just loves the car Thank you Hyundai and keep up the good work
0,Really spacious and comfortable Engine has plenty of power and does decent on gas mileage I enjoy driving it very smooth and handles very well I would recommend it over the Rav 4 or the Ford Escape It has more power and is a much better ride One bad note the transmitter for the doorlocks went out the first week we had it
1,I bought my 2007 Elantra in December I dont have a lot of miles on it yet but so far I love it I have been looking for other 2007 Elantras on the road but so far I havent seen any I am not sure why that is I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a great midsize sedan for under  dollar20000
0,A fun to drive vehicle Good performance excellent road holding and good steering mechanasim
1,Best thing about this car isnt the price which is awesome its that its bigger than some midsize sedans in fact its bigger than most midsized sedans of the 90s yet competes with the compacts of the worldmazda3 civic corolla etc You get so much more standard features warranty for so much less money whats not to like The corolla is so outdated the civic is great but honda dealers are way too proud of this overpriced car as they dont like to come off sticker the mazda is a good price but you still get so much more with the elantra Hyundai has come a long way since the 90s just try one out for yourself
0,After driving a large SUV I was very impressed with the handling of this much smaller one I drive a lot of rough country roads and the handling around potholes and gravel roads was impressive as well as the comfort on the interstate I was shocked with the quality of the interior and the attractive look of the exterior What a great little suv for a reasonable price I test drove several other small suvs and this one outranked them all by a long shot
1,I bought this car to replace a 2003 Elantra GT 5 door which was a good car It was a pretty good car until I was in an accident 10 months after purchasing it I was hit head on and the drivers airbag did not deploy when it should have At least the seat belt worked I contacted Hyundai about the airbags not deploying Hyundai didnt seem to care Since the Elantra depreciated quite a bit in 10 months I got a disappointing check from the insurance company after my car was totaled I went out and bought a Mazda 3 which was my 2nd choice Hyundai has standard airbags in their cars but I guess the deployment of the airbags is optional Thanks Hyundai but no thanks
0,I love the drive and feel of this car Compared it with others such as the RAV4CRV etc and you cant beat the value It is not quite as refined as the CRV on the inside but boy does it out perform it
1,I have had my elantra for almost a year now I want to advise anyone out there looking for a car to make sure to look at this one The fuel economy is good about 30 mpg but i do a lot of highway driving The size is wonderful Im very tall and it was the only car I looked at that I didnt feel cramped in The best thing about my car was the price I spent about 3000 dollars less
0,This is just a beautiful SUV We just purchased and are still in honeymoon phase It drives smoothly compared to our full size trucks and seems to have all the bells and whistles that we hoped for This is beautiful  everyone at work is jealous Go ahead and do it upgrade and get the leather interior Its totally worth it
1,I got limited and I enjoy this little car I got heated black leather seats and fog lights Live in NYC so I get about 23 mpgs but thats 95 percent city driving The interior attracted me to this car very underrated
0,Front end probs fixed twice First front weheel drive vehicle in a while
1,Overall Very Good VALUE for the  dollar compared to Corolla and Civic 23 grand less Was about to buy Corolla but Elantra BLEW it away Looks better and is LARGER   and SAFER than both After driving over 6k miles and 6 months heres the COMPLETE deal below Too many reviews have the good but not the BADand there are some Dealership service HORRENDOUS   and sales person was big liar Medium bumps a bit harsh mileage no way near claim closer to 2830 localcity combo quick accelerating bit loud but quiets out Side mirrors nice   and big but too big when parallel parking BUT GOOD FAR outweighs the bad Its simply the BEST value for  dollar no doubt Watch out Toyota   and Honda Why pay more for less
0,Fun to drive We drove over 300 miles home for Christmas and had two dogs all of our luggage and about 20 presents and everything fit with room to spare It has the smoothest ride and easiest handling of anything Ive driven
1,i have been driving this car for 2 months and I thought I would get used to it but it just drives me crazy the way this car shifts into 4th gear at about 35 mph and then has no power When you slow down it will shift fine This is really annoying to me because I drive during rush hour traffic and the flow of traffic usually moves around 3550 mph
0,This is the first time I have driven a vehicle so agile and fun to drive It looks great in black and catches attention wherever I go Visability is good too since stand is a bit higher than others Very adjustable seats make it extremely comfortable on trips The youthful look first caught my attention but driving it sold me The value for what you get is worth it I would recommend it to baby boomers who do not want to drive around in some old mans Buick or Caddy My vehicle has the LT package with Pioneer sound system This adds enough high end quality that is only available on expensive SUVs Handling is very predictable and my wife raves about how it is her very favorite
1,I did extensive comparison between HondaCivic   and Accord and Toyota Corolla Did not include Camry because of bad cust reviews It is a shame that Edmonds Kelly Consumer Reports give a so so look to Hyundai and go GA GA over Honda and Toyota For cabin room comfort gas mileage funtodrive etc you cant beat the Elantra Plus the best price and warranty I have had mine for 3 months and love it as does my wife The Civic   and Corolla were too small The Accord seats are stiff while cabin room is almost the same The Elantra has more front leg room which I like and is much more comfortable Give this one a good look because it definitely beats the competition
0,Love the style features and performance However Chevy could have done a few things better No individual reading lights all lights must be on to read in the back No mirror lights or lighted sunvisor mirrors Power seat switch poorly located between seat and door Only have 2000 miles on it but find fuel economy somewhat low possibly not broken in yet When in the front passenger seat the roof pillar doesnt allow me to lean to the right or rest my arm on the door
1,Just bought a GLS and it seems good but Im used to Luxury cars Was sick of used cars so bought a new economy car instead The only thing so far is that there is a plastic engine cover that vibrates while idling causing annoying flapping noise under hood Great stereo system though
0,We got rid of my wifes fun car 05 Mustang and got the Equinox and we both actually like to drive the Equinox better At its price point it has to be one of the best small SUVs on the market
1,I didnt know what to buy when I started out looking I had a 1999 Saturn SC2 that took a dump at 75000 miles I was looking for something more reliable I can not believe how much I love this car in such a short time I test drove a few cars in its class like Honda and Toyota and I have to say that for the options and money this one is just better There are always going to be things that the others do better but Hyundai caught on that its the extras that matter I have the same extras as the SE but without the 6CD changer
0,it is so far the best vehicle for the money Ive ever bought The handling ride and interior space is second to none it looks great like something costing twice the money GM did it right with this one
1,My wife had a 2002 Hyundai Elantra which started falling apart We decided instead of paying costly repairs we would buy a new one First we looked into the Toyota Yaris and CorollaWe really didnt care for either of them We then test drove a Nissan Sentra which seemed great but the price was a bit higher than we were wanting to pay We decided to give Hyundai a shot again We test drove the new elantra and fell in love with it We choose the purple color but really it should be called Black Cherry This car was for my wife and she is very happy with it Best price and warranty out there for a small car
0,My husband and I wanted something that would be practical to drive the kids around in but we arent quite ready for a minivan Vacations pulling our boat are a breeze and the carseats go in and out with ease Its by far the best looking grocery getter in town
1,I am a longtime Hyundai owner I like the body style the comfort of the seats and the design of the interior Additionally the ultimate performance of the vehicle is better than prior models and the engine has more power However the manual transmission is difficult to say the least and I have driven a manual since I started driving The friction point is hard to hit and the shifting is not smooth Additionally the reverse is located in the same spot as 1st and does not easily come out of reverse to be put into first gear Also if you try to replace the stock stereo its almost impossible to find a wiring harness I ultimately had to have one shipped from New York to California
0,Excellent SUV Stylish compared to the rest and fun to drive Handling is excellent and theres room for my 3 daughters and dog Tows the bowrider boat with no hesitation
1,I purchased this car as a replacement for my Honda Accord LX Even though its technically a smaller car it feels just as roomy inside When buying this car I considered the Civic and Sentra as well but this car beat them both on features and price Neither Honda or Nissan could match the feature set that the Elantra Limited offered and it was at least  dollar2500 cheaper than the high end models of the Civic and Sentra For me I had to have a car with heated seats and with other manufacturers I had to go to a larger model with high end trim to get that so it was an easy choice to go for the Elantra Limited Only bad thing I can say is the cabin is a little noisy if the road isnt real smooth
0,The car so far has been great I love the exterior design However the interior is subpar and the radio seems bland Otherwise the car runs great and looks even better
1,So far this car has been performing as expected Im geting around 3334 mpg cityhwy mix driving Im having a hard time finding a comfortable sitting position sometimes it feels lke the back of the seet is poking my ribs the rear window view is not so good there is a blind spot on drivers side mirrior The car drives very soft the stearing took me some time to get used to but its ok
0,The Chevy Equinox is a true competitor against the RAV4 and Santa Fe I test drove both and the Equinox is the best one My decision made up of all the nice features the Equinox offers at a lower price than both the Santa Fe and RAV4 Also the styling is so much better than the other two The Equinox has a pretty quiet engine it can accelerate quickly and performs well The gas mileage is good considering its size The new and improved 2007 interior is better than the 06 one The truck is the biggest insideout compared to the Santa Fe and RAV4 Even the stock sound system is the best Overall the car is fun to drive and I am happy with my purchase This truck rocks
1,I purchased a 07 Elantra Limited last night and I must say I am very impressed The dealer had a Carbon Gray color with manual transmission and I fell in love Hyundai has come along way with the style and quality of their cars I plan on keeping this car for a long time
0,Compared drive with Rav4 and Ford Escape Drives more easily than Rav4 Ford surprisingly heavy to steer Fun to drive this heavy 5000lb machine Initial mileage around town about 19mpg Relatively new to me Solid and stable but ease of steering could possibly cause oversteering Visibilty on right side requires use of the side mirror Acceleration good for freeways Does not sway like my 95 Blazer tended to do
1,Overall I like my first Hyundai I had some initial problems that were scary The transmission had several episodes of rough shiftingjerking The Owners Manual said the transmission has a learning curve My last 5 Hondas never gave me shift shock while learning my driving habits The mileage avgs have been 29city and 33hwy after 1800 miles The car is quiet and comfortable Now my biggest issue is the Speedometer It was reading high by 9 percent Hyundai changed the Instrument Cluster which brought the error within their specs It still reads high by 8 percent and Hyundais DPSM will not allow any more work on this problem Everyone think about your odometer running you out of warranty early
0,The longer I drive it the more I love it The price was great more options for my money than the Mazda CX7 Have been getting 26 mpg The ride is smooth and comfortable My sixteen year old son who is 61 loves the back seat that slides back Everybody says it looks like a Lexus
1,The van looks good and drives nice but dont let that fool you The fuel economy is no were near what we were told The brakes are a disaster and needed replacing after only 35000 km rotors and all The idler failed after 50000 km Had to be towed for a computer failure the latches on the side doors fail if you open the drivers door in the rain you will not be able to close the gas cap door There are problems with the wiring in the back door there are always light on the dash that shouldnt be on  last being a problem with the air bags If you dont live next to the dealer ship or want to keep the van past its warranty dont buy it
0,Has a good road feel and drives well predictable positive handling Mileage around 27 winter and 31 in the warmer months Avgd over 35 on a 1000 mile road trip last summer Nice smooth powerband but 22 wont snap your head back on inclines Utility is well designed with the plastic floor and sides rear seats that fold flat Rear seat leg room adequate comfortable Drivers leg room a little narrow but sliding the seat back helps Telescoping wheel would be a good overall remedy for this Engine is nice if you do you own basic maint Oil changes a snap with that top load filter plugs easy access fluid fillers like that Good daily runner Economical practical comfy
1,Ive owned the vehicle for 2 12 years   and have over 64000 miles the only problem I ever had was the sliding doors getting jammed we just had them repaired nationwide problem we were told never had any other problems dealership has great service they remember me by name when I go in for service oil changes regularly the only thing I dont care for is the resale value there is none depreciates too quickly
0,I have had my used HHR which by the way I just found out means Heritage High Roof for 13 months It does have a high roof but you cant see out the windshield very good at a red light All in all I really like the car I hope I am not jinxing myself the other members of my family always want to drive my car instead of their own My mother can get in and out of it with no problem which is a problem in other cars I have always owned a van and at first I thought WOW how small but I just went on a camping trip and was able to get everything in comfortably I wish it had roof racks though I have recommended this car to friends and family because of the price and reliability so far
1,I bought my 2007 Entourage in Spring of 2007 Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought it Every time I bring it in for service I am told that nothing is wrong with the doors Only other problem is the gas mileage averages about 17 MPG  not what I had expected I want to get rid of it so bad  but the value has dropped so much  i cant get rid of it
0,I started shopping for a roomy vehicle that i could afford and could afford to run I didnt have the need for speed or a handling package since most of the work the car would be doing would be on the interstate With the HHR I feel I hit the transportation jackpot I regularly fit a string bass 2 amps several guitars a sax or 2 and three humans inside fairly comfortably Over the life of the car so far I am AVERAGING 299 mph Fully loaded on the hiway Ive never done worse than 335 mph Splitting the gas 3 ways at todays gas prices that works out to about 2 centsmile The HHR is quiet comfortable and very reliable Easy to drive a great turning radius and very easy to park
1,Bought used in Dec 06 with 11000 miles It was Factory Reps vehicle Was sold on Hyundai because of previous experience with Elantra and Sonata This van has had 22 warranty claims since bought The van is very competitive with Toyota and Honda in design and function just not in the owner satisfaction category I feel that the biggest issue with this van in the dealerships service Hyundai dealers remind me of the Domestic dealers from the past big on selling just not on service You should not have to continuously take a vehicle in for the same issue and be told we dont know whats wrong with it sorry about your luck They have fixed everything except the whine in right rear speaker
0,Bought my 07 HHR new in 2007 By the time 2008 rolled around it was worth about 10K less than the sticker price on a trade The car was much better built then my 2004 Cavalierbut that does not say much In my 20 months of ownership I had multiple electrical issues suspension problems and fuel mileage down to under 23mpg consistently It looks more spacious then it really is I would be more likely to recommend this vehicle as a used cardont get suckered in to buying a new one because it drops in value sooooooo quick you cant get your dollars worth out of it before it will be off the road My summary Decent car dont forget that you are buying a Chevy and it will cost you
1,Its not good to say that I was cheap because I just happen to get my moneys worth paying less which is 10000 to 15000 dollars compared to Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey We bought and wasted 31000 dollars for this PIECE OF JUNK After sales service is WORST They always advertise how great their warranty is but its just an advertisement Auto sliding doors are always jammed Instrumentation panel is not reliable Cruise control does not work properly Sharp edge on the steering wheel
