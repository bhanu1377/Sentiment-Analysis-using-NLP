0,Had for 1 year 14000 miles Excellent fuel economy 2730 on all highway No mechanical problems My wife would like an adjustable passenger seat seating position too low Fit and finish second to none RL has plenty of power I use it often on steep hills I like the styling much more than the 09 grille has a richer more elegant look than the 09 Handling is great in high speed situations far superior to the TL I like the exterior design quite understated however I do see the point of someone saying it looks too much like a Honda I understand the 2011 will be a totally new car AcuraHonda really does want to compete with the best from Lexus After all is said and done would I buy it again for sure
1,Number one attribute isno wind noise The only reason you can hear the quiet tire noise is because there is no wind noise Very comfy seatsGreat tech features Not enough power especially low end torque Phenomenal handling characteristics This car will turn on a dime with good manners Fuel ecomony is poor but I dont put on so many miles that its a factor
0,This has been an excellent purchase and both my wife and I are very pleased with the car My only comment is that I feel the passenger seat should have the same power features as the drivers side  ie the seat is too low for my wife
1,I love the car It handles very well a little sluggish compared to other car MB CLK 430A but is sufficient I had a little bit of an initial quality problem HID headlight on right side burned out first day or so Car was due to go back for dealer addons so no biggy Was kinda shocked though Key fob was nightmare for first two weeks I made the mistake of initializing the car with driver 2s key rather than the 1 key the car hated that It would madly and incessantly lockunlock and beep when I stood next to the car Reinitialized the car to the driver 1 fob and it hasnt happened since
0,So far I have owned the car for a couple of months and do not regret the purchase at all I bought it for safety primarily but realized that it also has the legendary Honda quality The details of this car are incredible better than the German cars and value wise by 15 K at least also The car feels like a tank but has the power to go when needed This car has near 300hp and you feel every horse The AWD is incredible it would take a bulldozer to take it off course
1,This is my 2nd TL  love the style Also have a 2003 G35 which Im thinking of trading but in no way will I buy the new 2009 TL Its become one of the ugliest new vehicles on the road also heavier   and bloated I think acuras 25 year old 2009 vehicle designer needs some design school mentoring Also the new ZDX not only has the ugly front but it also has an asteck type rear 5 of my professional colleagues who now have Acuras will not come back to the new  gen quirky styles Too bad its really a good engineered vehicle but then so are many of its competitors The G37 stats will blow out the new TL stats  and its not UGLY Disappointed in Acura
0,Like most readers Ive driven them all but this one delivers a lot of bang for the buck Does not handle like a 5 series will not out accelerate a 550i but it handles beautifully is great on the road and has an interior and audio system that puts the 5 series and EClass to shame Put that together with Acuras reputation for reliability and we have a BIG winner
1,This car has done what I thought was impossible Its taken the fun out of driving Outward visibility is useless Its like livingdriving in a cave The allback interior is hearselike and depressing The transmission is wonky It has an impossibletoread mind of its own The suspension Dont get me started It cant decide whether its a sports car or a sedan The gas mileage is horrible Sitting at idle in heavy traffic you can watch the needle on the gas gauge slip down down down The HVAC controls are confusing
0,This car looked like a terrific value but it has not turned out that way I was looking forward to Honda Reliability but too many things just dont work well or are gimmicky Fuel economy is atrocious 1415 electronics dont work that well runflat tires are super loud there is some wind noise key fobkeyless entry never works the same twice in a row Car is pretty slow off the line but decent on the highway Ride is too much of a compromise Handling is good but the Michelin runflats are lousy performance tires in all but the correct temperature range I came out of an Audi A8 and would NOT buy this car again
1,Fun to drive but does not go well in snow Great looking interior and very comfortable The Bluetooth is very inaccurate and extremely frustrating Any noise in the car ie fan or highway throws off the voice activation of the Bluetooth No dummy light for washer fluid Cigarette lighter too close to the transmission stick DVD stereo is nice but only DVD music works and there are very few of those and they wont work on regular CD players Tire pressure indicator goes on in cold weather I had planned to keep this three years but Im going to trade it in before hand Even though I am a Honda fan our Toyota Sienna handles the detail much better than my Acura TL I wont buy another
0,We wanted an AWD sedan after a string of average SUVs This vehicle is a beauty Excellent build quality and finish It would be difficult to beat the value for money It rides smoothly and is very comfortable We are delighted with our purchase so far
1,Ive owned 3 TLs and this one is a rattling piece of junk I cant believe Acuras quality has gone in the toilet Transmission is extremely loud and engine is already ticking The TL is a great value for the money but at what cost The ride is very stiff I would hate to see what the new S rides like The rattling interior will drive you nuts I mean virtually everything in the interior rattles due to cheap plastic parts If you travel and you are in the car for many hours a day THIS IS NOT THE CAR TO BUY BEWARE
0,Just purchased my RL Build quality equal to or better than Lexus A great value with current market support SHAWD useful in all weather not just snow A smart looking car however not screaming I am here Had a 2004 TL and liked it this is much more car I hope resale is as good on this as it was on my TL Also owned a 2001 BMW 525 no comparison The BMW was more like my TL RL does seem overpriced until you drive it
1,The car is flawless One warning there is a technological curve with setting up your phone and using the navigation Lots to read Second warning not all cell phones can be used to import the cell phone address book from phone to car I had to buy a new phone that would support all the features Its minor but my relatively new Razor was not able to transfer its information This is a great value Compare it to BMW 3 series and see what you get for the money I think youll be impressed
0,I drove a BMW prior to this and loved it but I am thrilled with my Acura RL It is so smooth very responsive comfortable as it could possibly be and has every possible bell and whistle for thousands less than its Teutonic competition I chose it over Infiniti M35 because in my test it handled better and I much prefer the looks GREAT car so far
1,First let me just say that I have been a staunch fan of the BMW 3 Series for years but I have to say that they have lost me with the newest model sedan and coupe Specifically the interior is low rentugly and for  dollar35K it shouldnt be So I test drove the TL and wow what a car Granted its not quite the road handler that a 3 Series is but it is just as good or better in every other respect Build quality check Ride quality check Interior spacecomfort better Acceleration better Value much better A similarly equipped 325i would have cost me  dollar7500 more Thats some serious dough Bottom line BMW lost me but Acura found me
0,If not the best vehicle for under  dollar40K it has to be in the top five Exceptional build quality great performance just a great vehicle First time Ive had strangers compliment my vehicle Would definitely buy again
1,I have owned HondaAcura products for over 10 years so when it came time to replace my TSX the TL was the logical choice I looked at the 335i G35 and IS 350 They are all great cars but each one had a few annoying features The TL TypeS has all the performance I need with a great interior and proven Acura reliability I have had the car for 2 weeks now and I do not regret any part of my decision
0,I love this car I havent had it long but I am very impressed with how well it handles the road The RL is a solid vehicle and is equipped with just about everything for less money than its competitors
1,I cant believe how much better the 07 Type S is over my old 06 TL Handles like crazy FAST Everything is top notch I bought the best
0,This car is just an incredible vehicle very high tech but easy to figure out The stereo is awesome love the subwoofer Controls are very accessible Voice command system works great Smooth ride dont even know you are going as fast as you are yikes Gas mileage not as good as I hoped but it is all wheel drive This car has many options that you would pay 10k more for vehicle handling is incredible and steering response is nice
1,I recently traded my 06 Cadillac CTS in for the new 07 Acura TL Type S I bought the Moroccan Red car with the upgraded 18 chrome acura wheels I LOVE this color car with the chrome wheels So if youre unimpressed with the gray TypeS wheels you should check them out The car handles well has more getupandgo than my 04 GTO and has optimal styling to boot The back up camera is totally great for parking The only negative I report is that it doesnt have the smoothest ride with the low profile tires That is a mere negative compared to everything that it has to offer
0,Drove high end MBZ and Lexus for decades Bought the RL for the seat bad back and took what came with it For 20K difference Im more than pleased with the result The RL is a dream to drive and the cornering is amazing The engine has all the power I need I concur with all the positive comments seen here and have only one big squawk I HATE THE STEERING WHEEL Its not the wheel thats so bad even if it is too slippery its that its loaded with so much stuff it looks like a game controller The shift paddles are right in the way for a clean grip as are the telephone buttons which I dont use either Remove that crap and sticky up the wheel and Id give fun to drive a 10 also
1,Just picked up this 07 TLS a week ago and think its about the coolest thing going the voice activation monster motor and MPGs The onscreen shows 30 MPGs on a regular basis and I find it hard to believe Will do a little division myself to see if its true When stomping on it it can get a lot less Got some of the speedo error reported on earlier TLs and thats kind of a surprise for an Acura Lovin it
0,The Acura RL wTech Pkg is truly a dream machine Dynamically engineered superb build quality fit and finish quality materials and technically ahead of its competition The RL is the best kept secret of 07 It goes beyond the Best Bang for the Buck this well crafted automobile has exceeded my expectations in every way
1,I got the new 2007 Acura TL Type S after my 2004 had been rearended twice I loved my 2004 Wish I had kept it now vs getting this 07 Sorry Acura this might be the last Based on my 04 my mom dad and several great friends bought one too Some have already dumped their car It has no power no soul the navi is junk live traffic is delayed 30 minutes or more bad in Atlanta The windows squeal Brakes are junk Stereo is bad This car does nothing for me My 04 had soul feeling control power looks like my 20 yr loyalty will end
0,The RL is a magnificent machine and far and away the best value in its class It is cram packed with cool technology and the AWD delivers amazing handling in all kinds of weather Fit and finish are supurb This car puts a smile on my face every day on the way to work each morning and tempts me to take the long way home each night Highly recommended
1,This is my third Acura second TL  had an 04 before this and sorry to say probably my last My first two were great cars This one however has had annoying problems Most have been fixed by the dealership but there is a noise coming from the brakes they have tried to fix 4 times and cant get it to go away for more than about 2 days at a time We also have a 2008 Infiniti G35 and I am much happier with it although I like the TL better on the highway more comfort that sport I am very disappointed that they cant isolate the noise that I hear ALL THE TIME fix it already Every time I get in the car and hear the noise I shake may head and say to myself last Acura I will own
0,The RL has been everything it was made out to be Interior styling is excellent and instruments easy to see and use Exterior is sleek with the exception of the standard wheels kind of boring The upgrade they offer cost  dollar3000 and you have to go to 18 rims Only knock I have
1,On a return trip to Dallas TX from Austin our average mph was 73   and gas consumption was 32 mpg did hit 33 for a short time Cant beat that with a stick
0,I compared the BMW 5 series Mercedes Audi6 and Lexus 350 No comparison The RL has SO many more features for the money it is no comparison The RL is SOOO comfortable to drive I got the tech package being a techie myself I love the quality and ergonomics of the interior design The V6 has some punch but not like a V8 my only complaint The AWD is simply awesome The Bose 10 speaker stereo is unbelievable
1,In first 11 months car was back to the dealer for 34 business days for repairs While the car has some zip many problems have plagued this car Engine would not turn over 3x and have replaced 3 batteries due to short in Hands Free Link and took dealer 2 times to correct the problem Car alarm chip has been replaced 2x as alarm goes off randomly Trunk latch has broken 2x and replaced by the dealer Car handles well in warm weather but does not handle snow well at all Expected a better experience for the price I paid for the vehicle
0,I enjoy owning the RL It is very comfortable and easy to handle Acceleration is mild for horsepower rating It behaves as though it has turbo lag Entry is awkward seat and steering wheel take position when I get in the car rather than waiting until door is closed or car is started Standard battery capacity is low Have had to charge battery twice from sitting car with engine off trying to learnprogram the computer navigation system Fuel economy is good
1,After test driving a number of sedans I chose the TL over the Infiniti G35X The TL is roomier and has a sporty ride with tight handling I loved the growling exhaust of the G35X but my wife thought it was too noisy Oh well So far I havent experienced any rattling and cabin noise which is a common complaint Im 63 and have trouble positioning the seat and steering wheel for optimal comfort My hands and arms get sore on long trips Im clearly biased toward the Acura This is the third Acura Ive owned I traded in a 1990 Legend I hope to keep the 07 TL for many years as well
0,I drive 120 miles per day RT from Long Island to New Jersey About 45 miles is on highways with traffic with about half during high traffic rush hour Average speed about 40 mph Gas mileage typically 2223 mpg On longer non traffic trips 26 mpg Never got less than 19 mpg Car has 12000 miles no defects or repairs Very comfortable all the power you need handles well nothing to really complain about
1,With 12000 miles on the TL Good points  the car runs better now  improvements in both gas mileage 31 MPG straight highway trip and a smoother shifting transmission too much shift shock before Bad points  the car developed various squeaks and rattles over the last 11 months  glovebox center speaker driver vent instrument cluster etc  most of them now fixed The colder weather has brought an annoying drivers door   and window rattle The interior headliner roof was replaced twice due to its two layers separating Also knowing the Acura service department employees on a first name basis is getting old I prefer just oil change visits like with my previous 2 Acuras
0,Quality perfect never back to dealer for anything except for free car washes I owned Porsche and BMW quality can not compare  great value and better overall perfomance
1,10000 miles into my silver TL TypeS with 6 speed manual and I figure I would give you all a followup First the bad rattles in the door and steering column Tsk tsk in a near 40grand sports sedan Interior materials scratch real easily and dashboard is starting to lose its color really quickly from dark gray to milky gray Torquesteer is getting old now The good this thing should be called a musclesedan instead of a sports sedan because thats the demeanor it has Big mean looking mean sounding and fast Handling is second only to BMW Interior is very comfortable and very spacious
0,Truly have fallen in love with this car because of its intelligence The german offerings do not have the creature sensitivity the Japanese can create The driving experience includes more than just speed or performance Integrated with its performance is driver comfort and assistance If you appreciate deep intelligence in designget this car and you wont want to ride in any other car when you go places
1,My only complaint is interior rattles Cant figure out where theyre coming from or how to make them stop Not that theyre constant mostly on the rougher roads but still unnerving Other than that love the car If you drive it hard your tank will be empty in no time but that is to be expected with this much power
0,I really love my Acura TLType S The fit and finish of this car is really nice Every time I walk out and get into the car I look forward to turning the ignition key It drives very well on the open road and the freeway We took a 6K trip this summer and the car turned out to really be a great touring sedan I think it is the best looking car on the road on the outside I find the seats comfortable Braking is superb Overall I think it is one of the best designs ever If you can pick up a used one what a great value it will be
1,Loved the car until the power steering pump had to be replaced after only 3 days Car made loud rattling noise and had to be taken for service for the problem Very disappointed and would not buy the car again
0,I cross shopped all the others in this class Lexus Infiniti even BMW and Mercedes I couldnt get anywhere close to the options for the money This car comes loaded for less The build quality is great the engineering in this vehicle is superb They thought of everything Every surface has a pleasant texture the switches and knobs operate perfectly with weighted balance The Navi is a must it transforms the experience in the car Others just have a moving map of sorts this becomes the control center for the car Audio climate everything You can use conventional buttons touch screen or voice commands Handles and drives well for a larger car Very sharp design inside and out
1,I traded in my 05 TL 5AT for 07 TypeS and I absolutely love it I test drove the IS 350 but I didnt like the riding quality space was too small and also it didnt have option for manual transmission TypeS was exactly what I want it I was going about 40 mph and upshifted to 6th gear to see if this car could handle a stiff hill without stalling and it did It accelerated and gained more rpms as it was reaching to the top With  dollar4000 more than base TL you get all the options NAVI brembo breaks 35L engine sport tuned suspension etc
0,This has been the best car overall that I have driven It looks good is screaming fast faster than similar Lexus BMW and Infiniti Ive driven BMW 330xi was a close second to purchase but a little plain on the interior and definitely overpriced No problem with rattles except center speaker and only on extremely rough roads read eastern Washingtons I90 The sound of exhaust sealed deal for me Sweet music to the ears I often turn off the amazing DVDA surround just to listen to the car Beautiful I have yet to find a smoother V6 Great looks Solid build Well thought out No problems at all Brakes are fantastic Kids get creamy leather dirty but cleans up nicely
1,To start off I owned a 2003 Type S as well I drove the car to 100000 miles with only 1 problem a broken axle I loved the car but sold due to the higher mileage and purchased a 2003 Audi A4 6cyl 30 engine I never liked it and kept only 5 months I test drove the G35x IS 350 BMW 3 series and FX35 Infiniti and chose the Type S again This car is very fast and fun to drive The handling is great but the ride is just OK but I guess if you dont want that type of ride buy the regular TL still happy Really no complaints but I do only get about 19 MPG I guess thats not too bad considering how impossible it is to not drive like a complete maniac
0,40k miles and no problems except for battery dying but Acura replaced it free This car runs as well as it did when it was brand new Im reading a lot of posts complaining about squeaksrattles but on mine its minimal Since buying this car I did drive a friends G35 which definitely has better acceleration off the line However the interior trim and lower cost of the TL still makes it the right choice in my book One negative think I agree with is the ipod connector I honestly didnt even know it existed until reading these posts because its in such obscure location
1,1500 miles and only one problem Rear deck was vibrating from the subwoofer They took out the back seat and sprayed some foam back there Problem solved I researched for seven months prior to purchasing The Acura TLS blows the doors off anything out there in its class BMW Audi Infiniti etc The technology in it is amazing and not a la carte like all the other MFGs out there Gas mileage is a bit disappointing  I am avg around 20 MPG But blazing acceleration 286 HP baby Car is a real headturner Quad exhaust really sets it apart with the deep exhaust tone People stop me all the time to check it out Not many on the road which is a plus
0,Oh our beloved TL Your misgivings are few but substantial Weve owned the car for 28mos24k now Designed and destined for success in a North AmericaOnly market I feel its a moderate success Unlike some competitors the cup holders really work The seats and driving position are magnificent for those of larger proportions The stereo is phenomenal Fuel economy is above average the value equation is substantial The shortfalls however drive us insane The 45series tires seem to have temper tantrums with the suspension tuning The steering is incredibly vague and twitchy offcenter The transmission is clunky and crude Lowend power is absent Wouldnt buy another
1,I have had this vehicle for about a week now It came w the technology package The ride is rather sporty and bumpy a bit comparing it to my wifes Lexus ES 300 but enjoyable In the looks department it gets 2 thumbs up and since I havent yet broken it in I can talk about performance just yet Everything is voice controlled which makes a great conversation piece but voice control and command is too buggy With the windows up no fan running and no one else in the car I can not get the bluetooth to record the numbers correctly I have tried over and over and it seems as for certain numbers time after time throws some extra digits in
0,For a luxury car the TL performs well but is underpowered compared to others in the same class like the Infiniti G35 and the BMW 3 series The suspension and handling is impressive at the expense of a smooth ride and a very poor turning radius The 07 automatic transmission is less responsive than what I would expect from a luxury car Trim and paint quality is no better than the paint used on Honda cars while paint on the Infiniti is better Road noise and rattles are the biggest issues with this model and Acura and Honda in general There are known rattles in the 2007 TL many coming from the window sills front and back Most do not happen all the time thus hard to trouble shoot
1,When I first bought the Acura I loved it except for a minor vibration in the steering wheel I brought it in a while later and the dealership fixed something else They messed with the brakes The wheel vibration is now worse and I have vibration in the brakes now as a result I have been told that this is a problem with the TSXs and cant be fixed I guess Im stuck with it The car does drive very nicely on the highway though
0,I love my Acura but been having things go wrong Navigation has been replaced once already and now is still freezing up Dealer says not sure what problem is A lot of rattles inside cabin Engine panels are being scratched by hood along with the strut hood support Plastic caps on door and door panels rattle loose plastic covering comes off on door pockets Front grill piece of Acura logo starting to rust Why did they put a tape cassette player in it Plugging in iPOD cable a joke and hard to operate when wire is snaked through arm rest Why put heated seat buttons near cup holder Coin collector keeper comes loose all the time when arm rest lifts up
1,This is the 2nd new acura Ive owned I had my previous acura for 9 years Ive had this 06 TSX for 13 months and it is a disappointent compared with my first Performance looks and features are good The issues are with the multitude of rattles and squeaks that developed within 6 months in the interior and the ineffectual wiper system on the driver side which the dealer cant seem to address fluid dribbles onto the windshield and wipers  new and old  only smudge and smear they do not clear very well at all These quality issues are surprising The visual and auditory annoyances distract greatly from the driving experience
0,I purchased an 07 TL after owning 2 accords Notable step up Fit and finish is superb Comfort is fine for a 6 footer Performance is generally very good Low speed torque  gearing can sometimes be annoying Brakes are as smooth and quiet as any Ive experienced It does not handle like a race car but it is not a race car For its purpose and market handling is fun and responsive Mechanics and reliability after 22000 miles is perfect I do not share other writers experiences with rattles This car is well insulated Not the first rattle in my experience BTW the sound system is great but I do agree that the ipod jack is poorly located
1,I bought an arctic blue 07 TSX last weekend This car was not on my radar at all I was sold on either 328i or IS 350 But when I looked at all the features that are standard plus honda ivtec engine couldnt pass this up and I am glad The seats are firm and supportive The engine is sweet after 3000 rpm Not bad to drive in automatic I am a manual tranny lifer The gadgets are great Although the stereo system sounds little bit artificial its not bad My wife loves it even though I am driving it to break it in I guess that breakin is going to be at least a year
0,This car is amazing especially considering the price We looked at the IS 350 and the G35S The TL Type S has more bang for the buck It comes fully loaded with touches like a back up camera Weve had our TL for 3 weeks and have put 1000 miles on it The fuel mileage did improve after the break in period and is now averaging 22 mpg This car is not only fast but very entertaining If youre a techno geek this car is for you It has so many features it comes with 3 manuals Im still learning the Nav system Steering wheel controls for climate radio blue tooth phone and voiceactivated Nav are great and add to safety I find myself using two hands on the wheel more
1,This is an excellent car I bought a store demo to save a few bucks Its the right size with a sportyluxury ride very well equipped moves well and gas mileage that wont make you mad buying premium The nav system is great but I didnt need it and wasnt paying another 2k for the novelty
0,If you believe an ultimate driving experience is more than just rubber on the road then the TL Type S is sure to please My daily commute is approximately 95 percent freeway in Northeast Ohio I dont slalom or corner hard so the rear wheel drive experience is lost on me The TL does exhibit torque steer but that is really only noticeable when using the Manual Mode and accelerating hard I was surprised to experience torque steer shifting into 2nd but with 286 HP I should have guessed This car is a dream to drive and the interior design technofeatures and build quality far outdelivers the BMW
1,This car is a legend Dont waste your time investigating other sedans It has got everything you need in a mid size sedan I have been driving this for the last 6 months Apart from low mileage I am getting 21mg I have no complaints Moreover the navigation system is best in class Perfect buy
0,So I picked up my Type S about 12 hours before writing this review boy it is one thing of beauty I got the Blackhawk with the taupe interior a thing of beauty the paddle shifters are way better than shifting manually and they are very precise I went from a 2005 Nissan 350z to this sweet ride and it was well worth it I am getting used to the luxury of having a backup camera and the navigation is a joy Even though I live in New York City I dont plan on getting lost much any longer Well overall I give it a 999 out of 10 Hope this helps ps go for the 2 tone interior it looks cool too
1,Im constantly having to fool with power window controls So sensitive it either goes all the way down or all the way up hard to get it right where you want it Arm rest design is poor and blocks access to cup holders and hand break Eats oil like there is no tomorrow Performance is great Nearest dealer 1 hour away which is a drag
0,I compared the Type S with 6 speed manual to BMW 335 and Audi A4 The TL is much more roomy inside especially the rear seat footlegroom TL more like BMW 5 series for interior room I bought red exterior with lighter interior  was gonna get black interior but decided too dark TL has highest crash test safety ratings highest Consumer Reports score for its class entry level luxury The navigation system is excellent and easy to use The clutch is perfect and the shifter snicksnickety smooth  real nice The motor sounds awesome  like a turbo almost and car is fast Car is a real pleasure to drive Audio system is excellent Good value
1,Bought my first preowned Audi after owning Lexus ISlooking for better mileage Brakes squeak at low speeds  had them cleaned to remove carbon build up but week later same problem Havent called the dealer back  anyone else have this problem
0,Ive had mine for about three weeks now and had an accident on the passenger side The airbags worked perfectly Only the ones that should have deployed actually did The other car hit me fairly hard and the doors protected the passenger side appropriately VERY FUN TO DRIVE Reminds me very much of the older BMW 540 lots of torque and tons of horsepower The only real difference I can see is that its made better has more features and costs an awful lot less Its also a lot better looking than the new Bangle bimmers The technology in this car is unsurpassed Maybe a  dollar90K Mercedes has it beat but I didnt pay  dollar90k did I 
1,I have to take my car in every 1500 to 2000 miles to have oil put in because the car is burning the oil so fast This is my 3rd Audi and I purchased this one under the assumption it would be like my others oil change every 10000 miles I was wrong The dealership keeps telling me this is normal and I dont believe them Ive contacted a lawyer because I want my car fixed before it goes out of warranty and find myself needing to replace a  dollar10000 engine
0,The car is incredibly fun to drive Engine is so sweet transmission precise awesome seats technology galore the redwhite instrument panel is truly a thing of beauty like a jet cockpit I had to replace two rear defective struts and fix a rattle in the back but other than that I just love to drive this car I looked at G35 and IS 350 and this one was the best especially in rear leg room And has the best combination of options for less money I drive my Type S just to drive it sometimes drive around town just for the enjoyment And I love how it looks and all interior features Nice NICE car
1,Several issues with the vehicle 1 Engine Noise  the car sounds like a diesel Not Quiet it will bother you Dealer says that is the injectors 2 Brand new Car that burns oil according to Audi corp the engineering tolerances allow for a quart to be burned every 1200 miles  All I can say is WOW This is a serious problem that will cause engine failure in the Future 3 The HID Lights vibrate Taken in on several occasions there is an NTSB release on this safety issue AUdi wont do anything about it till someone dies 4 Poor Value Poor Resale Value 5 TURBO LAG     Turbo Lag Step on the Gas Pedal and count 2 missisippi God forbid you need to quickly accela
0,I recently traded my 01 BMW X5 44 sport package in for the new Acura TL TypeS I love the TypeS performance and all the toys are in
1,Great engine handling and transmission Unfortunately the suspension is so hard it transmits every bump and crevice from the road right to the steering wheel and cabin Makes for a nervous ride Truly unfortunate I feel like I need to see the chiropractor after every drive
0,Traded in my BMW X5 44i for the 07 Acura TL It was a wise decision The TL has a totally comfortable and smooth ride I love the bluetooth oh did I mention the better gas mileage I am sure they will be changing the body style within the next 2yrs I will probably tradeup then
1,Great car for driving around town Convertable is really fun and in the winter quattro really gets you through One issue I have is that on a long trip the drivers seat becomes very uncomfortable to the point of painful I have had the pad replaced but it didnt help I use a towel on the seat for long trips Additionally the german car makers need to upgrade their Nav system Toyota and Acura systems win by a mile
0,I tend to keep vehicles for 10 years and previously owned a 1998 Honda Accord 4cyl which I had clocked 190K miles and was looking to upgrade After looking at the 2007 Accord 6cyl I was attracted to the body style and features of the Acura TL The negotiated price was close to that of the Honda fully loaded Since I adore the reliability of the Honda engine and drive train I decided to give the Acura a closer look I am not disappointed The car is quiet gets great gas mileage I average 3032 on the highway and has power to spare when needed The inside is comfortable the ride solid but not too stiff I love it Turning radius   and high octane gas are the only negatives its worth it
1,I purchased a new A4 Quattro On the way home the ESP light would intermittently stay on the dynamic headlight warning light came on and stayed on The cruise control did not work the next morning I pulled out of the garage and began driving to work the same thing happened and got worse the turn signals would not work as well very poor car I have immediate glitches hassles embarassment pulled up at starbucks with coworker in car and had to open the door to get the order and this is all on the original tank of gas
0,Being a California driver our freeways often have slow pokes and indy drivers mixed in the fray I can not tell you how much confidence this car gives me to pull into another lane and pull away from somebody running up my rear camera I have had the porsches bmrs and mbz This car is a kick in the pants awesome sound system and good looks to boot
1,Bought my first German made car Almost bought a ford fusion but when I really sat down and saw the better engineering beefier parts and the technology on this vehicle the difference easily went away from the v6 opponent All I can say is I got 36 mpg at 65 mph 32 driving slow 45 mph in stop and go traffic around town Vehicle kicks with the cvt which you can make drive like a regular transmission but that burns more fuel and well you dont need it
0,A great car indeed for the money Performance is very good and overall a great car to drive
1,I shopped all the brands in this price point thought the BMW was too small and cramped thought the Lexus was just too boring and the MB a little too old I like the ride handling mpg price and stereo in this car The price came in under all the competition and the complementary maintenance was very nice However I have not been able to enjoy it since out of the first 39 days of ownership its been in the shop for 23 days I dont know if I got a lemon or this is indicative of Audi quality Either way I do not recommend this car and I wont be buying from Audi again for a long long time
0,My last two cars were 2005 Mazda 6V6 and a 1997 Nissan Maxima I love the voice command navigation voice and bluetoothcell phone I wish I would have just purchased this car before any other I would have saved time and energy
1,Couldnt help but notice the earlier review about a new engine failure I brought my 2007 32 Cabriolet in for its 5000 mile service and when a new engine noise appeared immediately thereafter on the passenger side Audi replaced the engine seemingly knowing what the problem was right away One of the cylinders had an obvious machining defect that the service department kindly showed me Audi should not saddle the consumer with this enormous market devaluation when an obvious quality control issue like this arises If youre buying an Audi like I did thinking I was smarter than all the other people who have nightmare stories to tell perhaps think again
0,From the test drive to the drive home to the drive way this is the most exciting car in this price range Ive ever driven My drive to work is 30 min and its not long enough for me to enjoy my new TL Sometimes I find myself driving the scenic route to work All I can say is this is a true drivers car  drive it youll love it
1,Since September of 06 this car has been returned to the dealer for a total of approximately 6 weeks to try to fix a serious mechanical problem  namely extremely hard starting in cold weather Based on Audis suggestions a number of the cars components including the coils and exhaust valves have been replaced but the problem has been neither identified or fixed The car has currently been at the dealer for almost 4 weeks with no progress
0,I traded in my Accord and S2000 for a car that combines the best elements from each car into one It has power quickness great handling great brakes great looks and more features than any other car I am hooked for a long time with Acura now and will never turn back I hope to see the SHAWD in 09 and will trade up to that Also I hear that even more power is coming
1,My new 2007 A4 already been the shop 3 times Need a new engine  2200 miles Very unreliable machine Very unhappy customer Would not buy Audi again Idle rough at morning start Dealer said it is normal for all 20T
0,This is my first brand new car amazed with the handling music system and Nav Excellent value for money Best in its class
1,My second A4 Avant and it is better than my 2003 was Faster better handling great looking both inside and out Better mileage and bang for your buck than any Benz or BMW out there For  dollar40k with most of the upgrades this baby rocks Black and beige is a babe magnet
0,The interior is fantastic and is open enough to accommodate many body types   and sizes Its more of a luxury sedan then a performance sedan The TL TypeS is basically the same as the TL except it adds a bigger engine with some added HP but its still attached to a FWD vehicle good for those who like the extra power The interior design fit and finish is excellent the exterior is getting to be a bit outdated but its still noticeable on the road Comes with Honda reliability and its fun to drive factor is high for a car thats not really designed to be fun to drive Fuel economy is on par for a sedan
1,I havent owned this vehicle long enough purchased 12007 to give a complete review I was pleasantly surprised at the power and response from such a small engine I find myself wondering why everyone else is driving so slow on the highway At slower speeds and around corners the handling is very quick with very little leanThe manual shifting with the 2T package takes some getting used to and frankly some practice The suspension is somewhat stiff but I think youd have to agree that it is race oriented The interior is comfortable and no nonsense Everything is there and nicely organized around the driver I personally liked the gauge positioning and control positioning
0,I traded my 06 BMW 530i for the TL TypeS My BMW had less horsepower and less torque and cost 15k more money Honestly I have more fun driving the TL TypeS
1,When I bought my 18T AWD dealer insisted it would last over 100k with no problem As soon as mine went off the warranty it several major failures headlight switch common in all Audis tensioner gasket huge oil leak demanding entire engine disassembly instrument panel dead horizontal lines and 2 secondary air pump failures Not to mention the quarterly visits to the dealer while the car was still before 30k to fix check engine light leaking hoses This is my last German car Driving it was lots of fun but I cant deal with thousands of dollars in repairs and repeat visits to the  dollar120anhour labor dealer Buy at your own risk  and read the forums before you do
0,In my opinion this car beats the G35 and IS 350 hands down Everything is standard and you get the honda quality plus lowest TCO in its class Ive read people complaining about its fuel economy but thats bogus I get 23 mpg average between city and hwy and I have fun with this car If you want 30 mpg then be willing to settle for less than 286 hp and slow down your driving For the power this engine pumps out and the size of the vehicle it gets great fuel economy
1,Took delivery Jan 28 07 Car was delivered spiffy clean and sparkling So far no serious defects of any kind  rather amazing in a complex machine Only a few minor complaints front cupholders could use redesign  one is under the armrest which needs to be lifted to use cupholder Windshield wiper moisture sensors work but not precisely enough  you need to help them along sometimes Occasionally there is a very slight hesitation when starting up from idle  seems to have lessened as time goes by  maybe I am getting used to it Very slight rattle in glove box door needs adjustment Thats IT This is a serious car  took fanatical attention to detail to build Fun to drive
0,I love the Ack I turned in a 2004 TL lease and got a new one I am hooked It is a sedan and sports car all in one Much roomier than the TSX with finer quality interior and engine I have no complaints about this car and plan on getting another one when my this lease is over
1,When I took delivery of my car and the brakes were very loud the salesman told me this was just a temporary problem and would go awayit has only been worse Srevice dept replybrakes squeak My 4 other vehicles do not have squeaky brakes The worst problem however is the delayed acceleration at slow speeds I will not let other family members drive this car it is not safe and again the service reps say thats just the way it is I will never buy another I own 2 Lexuses and have had no problems that were not taken care of ditto that for the 2 BMWs Audis indifference to these acknowledged problems is beyond belief
0,My silver 2007 called to me from the showroom floor I was tempted by the Aura but the lack of HID headlights and obvi was a deal breaker for me Wonderful paint quality interior and exterior design and the new wheels make a great difference This is my 4th Acura 2 TLs an 2 MDXs and new models always correct issues I may have had with previous ones Also Ive averaged 27 mpg in mixed driving over the first 2400 miles But ride is stiffer than I expected much stiffer than the Accord Try it before you buy it especially where roads suffer winter damage And I also have the fuel light problem although mine comes on after 13 gallons are gone from the 17 gallon tank  most annoying
1,I bought this car in October last year after three months I have yet to find a thing that I dont like it took me no time to get used to the mmi and the voice command is very responsive I got the black black in and out which shows the crafty style and quality more apparent I like the A8 that much Now I am dreaming the S8
0,This car is like Heaven to me It rides across bumps in the road very smooth The interior is just so comfortable I could just sleep in my car
1,I purchased my A8 on 110406 This is not the long wheelbase model but the shorter A8 If my dealer told me the truth this the only A8 in the Audi Central Region with the 20 Sport Package The car is not only a knock out in looks but a blast to drive Great performance plus all the luxury you could ever want I traded in a 2006 Infiniti M45 Sport so you know I had to go some to find a better vehicle Audi needs to advertise this model more
0,Its fun to drive again After 20 years of driving basic transportation I once again have a car that I take out in the evening just for the pure pleasure of drving The Acura TL is simply the best car I have had Selected over the Infinit G35 and BMW 328i because of total cost of ownership and value per dollar
1,Ive experienced an unnerving hesitation occurs at low speeds ex parking lots or left turns when a full stop is not required The accelerator must be pumped several times before the engine responds Dangerous at times so Ive learned to adapt to the quirk Audi has looked at the car twice so far and says there is no apparent problem and my experiences cant be duplicated Dont find it to be particularly nimble unfair comparison perhaps to my previous MDX Very quiet and luxurious with very good visibility
0,Bought a 2007 Acura TLS in late January and I love it I was choosing between the TLS and the Lexus IS 350 Went with the TLS because it was bigger and more roomy than the IS 350 The car has quite a bit of get up and go and will do 060 in under 6 sec Handles very well Interior is very nicely done and the car looks great from the outside It is really the ideal blend of sportiness and luxury and comes loaded I love the NAV system and the bluetooth is great I love the seats too  very comfortable Tip for those who do not like the TLS wheels I asked the dealer if he could trade out the TLS wheels for the regular TL wheels and they were happy to do it for no extra charge Try it
1,Important to note I am a grandma and a teacher I do not speed I always take my car for service promptly I am absolutely outraged with the quality of this car I only have 19000 miles and I need a NEW ENGINE How ridiculous is that This vehicle has had many faults One example is that emergency brake locked on me while I was driving on the freeway very scary Other defects Window mechanism broken on both front windows Molding coming off headlights fogged from inside bad brakes BE AWAREthe bluebook price has drastically decreased FIFTY Percent Overall DONT buy an AUDI I wish I never did
0,I have had 2 Lexus GS 300s  very nice   and reliable but BORING and overpriced Had a 2004 Infiniti G35 loved it but had a few quirks that the dealership couldnt get fixed G35 got totalled and bought the Acura TL one week ago I love this car it comes weverything drives and feels better than the last cars I have had even the Lexus Love the Bluetooth This car came with the extras that I had to pay extra for on the other cars Couldnt have made a better decision and the price couldnt be beat Why pay  dollar40K for a car with fewer options and poorer styling
1,Despite meaningful priceincentive at purchase discount cant make up for poor quality and ongoing issues Brakes and tires needed replacing at 25K mi in response to which dealer congratulated me for outlasting the average most customers only get 22K out of both at best Reason heavy weight Quickly upgraded tires they were pathetic in snowice  seems insane for an AWD SUV but had to stick with same lousy brakes due to some proprietary sensors anyone test this theory Sunroof rattles steering wheel vibrates at 70 mph 2nd row seat rattles like a 15year old Chevy pickup Dealer happy to keep trying to fix but sick of driving A4 loaners
0,I checked out the competition such as IS 350 and G35 and none can match the utility and value of the Type S The navigation on the Type S blows away any of the competition and it is just a handsome vehicle I get over 30 MPG when driving steadily at 70 mph I just passed over 600 miles breakin period and stomped on the gas WHOA Is this thing fast
1,Very nice looking car but brakes have been squealing since the day I bought it Resurfaced twice At 15K service told me I needed new brakes at the cost of  dollar2k Said they changed the warranty on brakes to 12K miles and I see why now Neither Audi nor dealership were helpful just basically said sorry From what I understand there have been many brake problems in this vehicle Brakes still squeal Terrible customer service from Audi headquarters and dealership and obviously do not stand behind their vehicles It is a fun car to drive but for the money I spent you would expect high quality and customer service Fuel economy bad even for an SUV DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE
0,Our first acura after having 3 maximas Maximas were all good cars but cannot compare to the TL It just seems so much more refined interior comfort is great and the ride is less harsh than our maxima se Only have it for a month but so far were very pleased
1,This is my 3rd Audi I have owned an A4 and currently still own an A6 I am disappointed in the reliability and quality of the Q7 I have only 28000 miles on this car and brakes are already going The tires also need to be replaced I have never owned a vehicle where the brakes and tires went bad at such low mileage The engine sounds like it is struggling all of the time and is sounding more and more like a pickup truck and not an Audi SUV We spent the extra money for the keyless start and it doesnt work when it is cold out I think the quality of Audis have definitely decreased
0,It was time for me to to get rid of 2003 RSX type S that Ive been driving for years The 2007 TL type S not only filled the gap that Ive been missing in the RSXS but surged my adrenaline beyond my expectation Smooth and precise 6 speed manual gear box w limitedslip differential and 256 lbft of torque are the 2007 TL type S strongest points that clinched my decision to buy this car I got to admit that I missed the scream from RSXS between 3rd and 4th when VTEC kickedin but TLS substitutes that w tourquey highpitched rumble exhaust modulation Superb and very comfortable interior supports my decision to buy another 6 speed manual car otherwise Im going to fall asleep
1,Our 3rd Audi This one is just not up to what we had expected Example  the gas door feels and works like a Yugo Instrument panel is directly under cup holders and any spills screw up the audio  dollar800 to fix and not covered by warranty Service has declined dramatically over the years It feels like they are trying to wring every dime they can from us at every chance Not much different than most but different than our past experience Have had for 15 years and seems like there is always some little thing wrong Engine is great great on snow If I had it to do over again I would get the GL 450 or 550 The Acura is more reliable but does not drive as well or turn as sharply
0,I used to drive a 2000 TL which got totalled recently as a truck hit me and rolled over the car I walked off with not even a scratch I went and got an 07 TL Even though overall I like the car I still think the acceleration is sluggish especially when I am going thorugh heavy traffic   and signals I can visibly feel very well the shifting of gears   and really wish it was smoother Other than this I like my car all the faciliies are wonderful especially the Handsfree link and the MP3 player
1,The Q is my 3rd Audi The car has good performance and room inside As my wife says this thing can turn on a dime and give you change It does have a great turning radius for this size of car Mileage stinks gets about 14gal Great handling on snowice in the mountains of Colorado Had to replace all brakes   and rotors at 18k miles at the tune of  dollar1200 Dealer said this was a common problem on this car No warranty coverage Just take it out of the pocket This should really be a recall issue but Im sure Audi wont step up to the problem
0,Absolutely love my Acura TL TypeS After test driving nearly every car in its class  BMW 330 Infinity G35 2006 Mercedes C280 Lexus ES 350 etc this car stood out as the best option for me It is comfortable had solid performance large back seat My only 2 complaintsare that it gets just okay gas mileage and the front end could be better styled Overall love it
1,I traded in a lemon 2002 A6 in for the Q7 Within 2 months of the Q7 purchase the windshield wipers collided during a bad rainstorm on the highway After 5000 miles the power lift gate stopped working and the back seat wouldnt lock into place After 19000 miles the tires needed to be replaced for  dollar1200 Then at 28000 miles the brake warning light came on  dollar1700 to replace the brakes and rotors There was a leak in the sunroof and mold started to grow on the drivers side carpet Great looking cars very poor reliability and very expensive to keep up From now on Im spending a little more for another BMW There is a reason you see many more older BMWs than older Audis on the road
0,This is my 3rd consecutive Acura 01CL 04TL 07TL Stype i was not satisfied with the ride on the 04TL and replaced the OEM tires with top line Bridgestones ride improved dramatically My 07 Stype has a harsh ride with the OEM tires I realize it has a beefed suspension but a tire change might be in order Otherwise I am delighted with the new Acura TL Stype It is an awesome vehicle in all respects
1,I enjoy driving the Q7 and it is a well built basic SUV Unfortunately for  dollar60K price tag Audi falls short on customer service and attention to detail I had serious electrical problems the 1st week I drove out of dealership and the dealers reaction was so what They fixed it but it was as if it was expected Next the battery died several times and had to be jumpstarted After bringing it in 3 times Audi finally figured out the Software had a glitch The MMI systemelectronic brain is unsealed and located below the tilted forward cup holders so if you spill even a little liquid on the shifter the MMI shorts out and it costs  dollar1000 to fix Audi said not their design flaw my fault
0,Car comes loaded with all features Handles well and looks great Best value for the  dollar dollar Other similarly stocked cars will run at least 12k more Im averaging about 24 mpg right now I hope to see a little improvement after break in but its not that bad If you like having all the gadgets in a car you will likely be pleased with the TL typeS The ride is pretty quiet but youll love cranking the dvdaudio disks anyway True surround sound in the car is pretty cool I fit my two kids in the back no problem I wouldnt recommend more than two adults youll be tight The type S comes with rims that in my opinion dont really work with all colors
1,Finally plunked down the cash for a German driving machine Great handling solid engine but what a disappointment on the rest From a jerky transmission no trouble found of courseand creaky transmission to a  dollar1200 MMI console from 2 drops of water and a door handle that fell off these last two I hear happen all the time Finish is falling off the console cargo net fell off twice gas door sticks open I expect far better for this price car Who is giving this all those 95s Are their cars still in the dealer lot or did I get a lemon
0,Bought a black exterior with black interior base 2007 in December 06 I love everything about the car except the gas mileage is a little below what I expected I drive about 70 percent street and 30 percent highway and I constantly get 20 MPG at best Also I wish the low fuel light would not be so premature It usually turns on and I only have to fill up 145 or 15 gallons so there clearly has to be 2 or more gallons left in the tank But other than those minor issues I love the car Its roomy and comfortable yet still has a very sporty drive and all the features seemed to be well planned out to make as easy as possible for the driver
1,I absolutely love my Q7 I will warn you though of a major design flaw If any of you ever drink a liquid while driving beware I spilled the smallest amount of coffee and it shorted out part of my electrical systemThis little spill will cost you close to  dollar1000 If you notice the buttons are directly in front of the cupholders What was Audi thinking Now when I have my coffee or water I put a cloth over the control panel
0,Traded a 2002 Audi A6 for the Acura Although not as luxurious as the A6 the TypeS is a whole lot more fun and rewarding to drive The engine is one of the best and pulls strongly at any speed I wanted a nice blend of sport and luxury and the front wheel drive TypeS does this very well
1,I have two children ages 4 and 11 months There is enough room for one car seat a booster seat and still room for an adult on the same row I owned a minivan before and although there is a little less room in the Q7 its not by much Love the way it drives MMI is really easy to work The only bad thing is it gets bad gas mileage But you have to remember it is an SUV
0,After driving a 2006 TL for several months and purchasing a 2007 base model here is my take on the differences The 2007 is a little better overall Its suspension absorbs bumps better than before while still maintaining its sportiness and handling Its quieter on the highway and its seats are more comfortable softer  especially on longer rides From the front the separate fog lights chromelike strip along the bottom and integrated blikers in the side mirrors give the car a more elegant look The sporty body style sporty handling and very comfortable ride made it a good choice for me Notes No squeaks or rattles the new transmission is now derived from the RLs tranny
1,Had a steering column bind would not adjust Audi replaced column works fine now Mileage is better than I expected 194 Find the cup holders some what clumsy to use The Bluetooth is great Had a 2005 Touareg that had front sensors and memory exit seat miss both of those Overall well satisfied
0,Test drove the Lexus IS 350 BMW 335i and TypeS TypeS best deal for the  dollar Not the fastest car but great for everyday use
1,Ive been driving an A6 for seven years and wanted to upgrade to an A8 but the price point was more than I wanted to spend so the Q7 was a great alternative  A8 size and comfort with the A6 price tag It is very luxurious inside and out and the 42 V8 accelerates nicely though not as quickly as my A6 27T The 3rd row seat is not for anyone over 53 but I only plan to use it sparingly and it folds down easily to provide ample storage My golf clubs can fit sideways unlike in the A6 or A8 One complaint is the ride is a little stiff and I can feel the bigger bumps in the road I have 20 wheels but didnt opt for the adaptive air suspension darn
0,We looked at a few cars that are considered in this class and the TL TypeS is by far the nicest looking nicest driving and the best bang for the buck The drive by wire is great and the torque is a nice surprise Great car drive it youll buy one
1,Third row What third row you mean you can actually get in it A child could wiggle in When the 3rd row is up that it no space left For the length of this car where has all the space gone As for auto trunk lid I broke it within 10 minutes Seriously Yes I know I should have read all the instructions but I dont expect guests and friends to have read the manual to properly operate the auto trunk lid This is a huge car with all the space used by the front half while we were buying it for the rear half Our mistake please dont make the same one
0,This is our first brand new car purchased in 26 years We are very glad we waited for this The car is everything we coud ever have wanted and more The nav sound system fit and finish truly superb and then you get to drive it WOW Only concern is the mpg which should get better with added miles
1,When you are spending in the range of  dollar55000 to  dollar65000 you deserve comfort I am quite disappointed with the 3rd row First the 2nd row glide rail is not flush mounted 2nd getting in to 3rd row is nearly impossible since seat does not retract fully 3rd there is no room for even feet between two rows Also no DVD player option
0,Decided to buy a 07 Acura TL type S instead of Lexus IS350 and BMW 330i and love it Nav is by far better than Lexus and you can fully use it while driving Over 600 voice commands on nav Zagat restaurant ratings real time traffic standard HID lights turn signals in mirrors super bright LED taillights red interior dash lights High performance Brembo brakes Real sport suspension with tight handling Twotone interior seating dual front cupholders and a back seat that can actually fit two adults Plus fully loaded w nav for  dollar5k less than Lexus or BMW with navi and has great honda build quality
1,I have been reading what other people are writing about the Q7 so I thought I would take the time to write one as well Performance happens to be really good its a fast car and it sits on the road well Comfort I have to say that it has been giving me a really bumpy ride This weekend I had people in my car and we took a long trip together and they all complained that it shook them up Interior designexterior design In overall its done really well except for the fact that in the backseat you cant seat any adults and when you do put down the seats you get very little room for cargo compared to other SUVs 
0,Although it isnt the best car in any category the 07 Type S does exceptionally well across the board  good acceleration excellent interior and standard features decent ride quality etc The most impressive part of the vehicle is its interior and the electronic gadgets that come with the car The navigation is extremely easy to use and I would have to say that only Lexus has a better nav system However I am finding that the fuel efficiency is quite a bit below what is advertised As a side note I test drove the 07 G35 AWD 06 TL A Spec and stock IS350 and BMW 335 The Type S was a perfect blend of what I wanted at good price point with the options included
1,I got my Q7 3 weeks ago I used to have BMW X5 and I just could not wait for the next generation due to time restrictions that I had Q7 is much roomier than X5 Since I have all optional packages I love to play around It doesnt ride like SUV but It does not like X5 as well I am not sure how it will be in snow conditions but I am expecting much better than X5 since Audi has 6040 split where X5 was more 2080 split on all wheel drive So far everything is looking good
0,Ive had my car for a couple weeks now and it is now my 3rd TL first was an 02 TypeS then an 04 with ASpec and now an 07 TypeS This car so far has handled nicely the looks are improved with Quad exhaust and the additional safety features are great So far MPG has been quite a bit lower hope that improves with breakin Performance is unbelievable acceleration feels more than previous TLs and steering feels much sportier and exact Interior fitnfinish is awesome backup camera nice addition much quieter interior than any previous TL almost too quiet Nice exhaust note And Im thankful Acura went back to NONINTEGRATED fog lights The perfect sports sedan for the Midwest
1,Simply perfect However I cant imagine this beast with anything less than a 8 cyl The mid range torque is a blast in the passing lane
0,This is my 2nd Acura TL Nav I just traded my 05 Anthracite for a new 07 Many people thought I was crazy but it was well worth it This car is much better than 2005 The ride is better the features extint the sound is awesome This car is a keeper I took white wtaupe this time since its more of a luxury color There is nothing not to like in the new TL Everything you need you get
1,Coming from an 2005 S4 my 07 RS4 is a completely different beast Has more power much better suspension looks better feels better just a better car and yes you pay for it However I would like to see more power because people who buy RS4s crave power and 420hp just isnt enough once you get used to it
0,As a proud owner of Hondas and Acuras for over 30 years I can attest to the quality of the these very fine automobiles Although a Honda man for over 10 years it was a girlfriend who turned me on to Acuras and its been a beautiful partnership for the past 20 years Recently I was involved in an accident that resulted in my hitting a tree and the car tipping over The Acura absorbed the impact well enough for me to make it out of the car without a scratch Yes I thanked God for watching over me on that day And I also thanked myself for having the wisdom to purchase one of the best built cars on the market Thank you HondaAcura
1,This car is just ridiculous You can carry a family comfortably in it and still will blow ANYONE off the line I had an S4 before this and its well worth the investment The best way to describe this car is an S4 on steroids I havent had any problems with this car and didnt have any with my S4 either Take care of the car and it will take care of you for sure No one ever needs a car this fast but why not have it anyway
0,Im not a fan of the wheels but like the color they are nicer in person than pictures show Torque steer is not an issue  I think Acura is limiting the torque on takeoff This could cut into 060 times though Speaking of which here are my guesses 060 in 56 14 mile in 143 The car pulls more once it gets moving A later test with my gtimer will confirm these numbers One thing of note is the sound system It is AWESOME Listen to the sample DVD that comes with the car and you will be sold Fit and finish is nice Handling is good but they put these junk Michelins tires on stock
1,I have 6000 miles on my RS4 with no vibrations no oil consumption and no questions of build quality The car is just wonderful Power is smooth and a lot of it there I am averaging up to 25 MPG hwy  avg speed of 79 MPH I want my gas guzzler tax back The car handles very well for a 4000 lb vehicle The 6040 frontrear Quattro bias is great I have yet to feel front torque steer which I found quite often on my B6 S4 On the streethighway the car is perfect On the track the DRC with the 400 lb spring rates is inadequate Esses  Infineon The brakes are not meant for track use and the pad wear will be a problem Replacement pads and rotors are not cheap
0,I purchased the 2007 Acura TL two day ago and I am very impressed The build quality inside and out is excellent Acura has addressed every little detail a customer could think of The ride is solid and the amenities are vast I owned a Mercedes C320 and it doesnt come close to the goodies Acura provides German makers tend to nickel and dime you over options packages that are standard on the TL So far  Acura has a customer for life The 2007 comes with a rear back up camera with the navigation package side mirror turn signal markers new 18 inch wheel design and retractable keyless entry fob
1,Dont judge a book by its cover This is all race and high performance from the word go A small innocent looking button on the center console is marked with a green S  it should come with a warning  no amateur drivers professionals only This car is for the owner that appreciates and understands performance
0,WOW What an upgrade I owned a 2004 TL and I just bought a 2007 TL TypeS and I love it It looks good aggresive even It drives aggresively as well When you own a sports sedan you should drive like it The F1 shift option is great With close to 300 ponies it flies The Brembo brakes are a plus The car turns on a dime and its just a blast to drive Its a 95 out of 10 in my book Buy it and you will love it It has all the gagets inside Navi voice recognition MP3 hook up 51 Dolby sound rear view camera XM radio Im sure Im forgetting some thing but theres just so much inside you tend to forget to list all the goodies
1,The title sums it all up This is one great car You just cant find this level of performance in a fourdoor AWD sports sedan Read the glowing automotive press reviews and realize that they are not just hype The car is really that good Forget about the competition because this car blows them away
0,I had a 2005 TL with Navi and I was waiting for the new improved TL I m glad the TLS came finally and I had the pleasure of buying it a few weeks ago It has everything I ever wanted in car especially at this pricepoint So test drive one and you will fall in love with it too
1,After multiple M3s and Porsches this cars performance and construction astound me Brakes  surreal I feel like I just begin to think about stopping and I am there all without any complaint squeal or nose dip Handling  I pull corners and Im amazed the car transcends all its weight and stays completely flat through the bends The stick is the stick I had in my 911 that I was always trying to get in my M3s with trying different short shifter kits Ergonomics  the way that everything is driver centered reminds me of my old BMWs Fit and finish has attention to every detail that I felt was there in Porsche but is lacking in most other cars This is a four door car that has world class performance and the fit and finish that it does I dont think that there is a better buy out there
0,My TL has proven to be the best value for the money car I have ever owned The interior is comfortable great nav system and bluetooth are extremely convenient engine is powerful providing great pickup on the highway when needed The number of features is immense and make it a car I hate to leave in the parking garage all day during work
1,Driving is great except for the shaking steering wheel at 6164 mph The performance on this is out of the world It must be more than 420 hp Also the glove box opens by itself After driving 386 miles the oil warning light came on and I checked the oil which was 15 qts low So much for quality Does anyone have quality control Another RS4 at the dealership has the same vibration problem That is two out of three that shake Hope the engineers can figure out how to fix this It would be bad if all steering wheels shook on this new Audi hotrod
0,Great car for a daily commute Plenty of toys and a wonderful sound system Comfortable seats voice command everything silky 35L V6 Definitely worth the price over a base TL Brembo brakes are also powerful and firm 1000 problem free miles so far in just 2 weeks Just keep on improving it Acura
1,I bought my S8 because I believed it would be a funtodrive relatively light weight fast sedan It has ponderous handling shifts erratically and is full of insanely complicated useless electronics The suspension lowers itself after parking so that the car has to be parked rearendfirst so the front doesnt hang up on the curb I tried to give it back the 2nd day I had it but Audi refused as S8s are special order
0,I test drove the BMW 335i and was very impressed but after driving the new TL Type S couldnt resist buying for  dollar10000 less than BMW Great looking car very fast tech features next to none Yes the torque steer is there but nothing I cant live with The biggest adjustment for me was getting used to firmer sports seat than the BMW 7 series I was driving but I guess that was unavoidable If you want a well built safe sporty sedan with high tech options this is the car Bluetooth voice activated Nav and DVD 51 audio are incredible
1,I like the car overall its my 3rd and so far no big problems until the 2007 version At 14k miles car starts lurching and dies total electronic failure Checked site to see if anyone else had the same incident I will post an update after my tow trip to the dealership
0,I just upgraded my 2005 Acura TL for the 2007 Acura TL Type S and was very surprised on the way it handled and looked The 2007 Type S felt tighter around the corners and the acceleration was much quicker than my 2005 TL As for the exterior of the car I was very impressed on the changes that they made including the side mirrors exhaust system and the added fog lights It looks very sharp As for the interior I love the ambient red lights in the Type S compared to the ambient blue lights The Navi was upgraded and works to perfection and I especially like the MP3 hookup so I can connect my iPod This is a No Brainer for all of the TL enthusiasts I will be keeping this one
1,My beautiful alpine white BMW 328XI AWD 4drsedan has been in the shop 12 times first time 6 months after purchase Major computer problemscomputer indicator pops up with visuals not in the handbook Service  BMW has had difficulty reprogramming the computer Poor handling dealing with pot holes Little things go wrong with the car all the time Car serviced at a different dealer than purchase BMW corporate says that the service dept has been able to fix the problems the car has had but the vehicle is not reliable and I dont feel safe driving it Afraid to drive the car long distances for fear of being stranded This ultimate driving machine is a NIGHTMARELEMON
0,Just picked up our 07 TL today and drove it home about 30 miles Beautiful car handles nice The new Nav system is cool with the backup camera when you put it in reverse Got a couple blind spots off both sides that I need to work on Ride is very comfortable not too soft and not too stiff Stereo is outstanding Enough gadgets to keep me studying for a bit I like the new gauges over the previous ones More later
1,I leased this car in February 07 and have about 6 months left on a 36 month lease I have just put on my third set of run flat tires at 30000 miles I wish I had checked the reviews of this problem before I purchased the car There are thousands of people who swear they will never buy or lease another bmw because of these miserable tires They are expensive and ride like a truck
0,I am in love with this new car It has very exhilarating performance I think that the fuel economy is marginal The transmission shifts quick and smoothThe TL TypeS is the perfect blend of performance and luxury comfortThe STANDARD rearview camera is very convenient The nav system is very easy to use and to understand Love the STANDARD bluetooth
1,I had the car less than a month when I hit a pot hole on the Long Beach Freeway popping one tire and bending two rims The ride is horrible when going over small bumps and it bottoms out on small speed bumps I had to replace both rear tires at 20000 miles as they were completely worn through on the inside The dealer helped with this due to the earlier problem but the tires should last much longer There is no window switch in the back seat The rear seat passengers have to ask the driver to lower or raise the window The car is beautiful but Im glad Im leasing it because its going back at the end of the lease
0,Traded a 2004 TL and the 2007 TL is much better no rattles and rides a lot better Fun to drive
1,I agree with all the other positive statements Things I didnt like were 1 the runflats and the fact that the car does not come with a spare or a jack kit 2 My car was built in 42007 and they were still using a fuel pump made by Seimens Many Seimens fuel pumps have failed and mine is having symptoms of failure long crank starts 45 seconds BMW has not issued a recall and is handling the issue on a case by case basis It is assumed that all new cars now have the improved fuel pump made by bosch although BMW wont confirm the date they made the switch
0,Previously leased two Acura RLs bought the TLS based on the quality build and driving experience of those previous Acura cars Wise decision Better than expected MPG to date265 for 38M miles which includes balance of cityhighway conditions Treadwear remaining40 percent Never an alignment problem Acceleration is outstanding Car is quiet comfortable and feels solid Pearl white exterior stands out in a crowd Maintenance expenses to date  dollar367 about  dollar01 per mile How the car may be improved 1 Larger vertical space for trunk opening 2 Fold down rear seats 3 Keyless ignition and 4 More foot space for rear passengers Even with these suggestions this is one firstrate car
1,This is hands down the worst vehicle I have ever owned Within the first 2 weeks it was in the shop twice for electrical problems Then when I was driving on the highway I hit the gas and didnt go anywhere and almost got creamed twice Performance is no where near all the hype and it is a very uncomfortable car to drive longer than 2 hours in The bluetooth feature is garbage and the recieving quality on whom you are calling is very bad The gas mileage is terrible in city and hwy driving Overall a terrible car
0,I had high regards for acura but after owning one for almost 2 years it is going down Brakes were gone after only 15000 miles Timing belt Idler pulley needs to be changed after only 20000 miles Passenger side mirror clicks and every time it needs to be lubricated My used car for years was not giving me any of these troubles Rattles a lot I only use car for fun I dont drive it to work I do no consider it as a luxury car and will not buy any Acuras in future and will recommend the same to family and friends
1,Always wanted a BMW 3series with 6speed manual Fell in love with the 2007 coupe but way past that now Underwhelming acceleration and torque below 2700 RPM Tranny has been big disappointment Maddening HVAC and radio controls Poorly shaped and sized storage cubbies Cant see instrument lights with sunglasses Under 3K miles had to replace driveshaft At 4K weird vibration in clutch pedal Dealer diagnosed bad throwout bearing and replaced whole clutch The vibration got worse Now they tell me itll breakin after 1015K miles Its hard to enjoy my drivers car when my clutch foot is tingling and Im being tortured by diabolically illogical controls and wretched ergonomics
0,Most cars I have owned I either loved or hated my 07 Types is a true lovehate relationship I love the looks and styling as well as the performance and sound of the engine OK now for the hate I hate that my almost  dollar40k car rattles everywhere inside The center speaker cover rattles The rear subwoofer make the deck rattle The interior itself is very impressive perforated leather seats and all After a month I also added tint to the windows and had it immediately ruined by the drive scraping a cut in the tint
1,After having my car for only 4 months the seat belt arm broke It took 4 visits to the dealership until they finally fixed the problem When my car was 10 months old the windshield wiper fluid pump stops working It took 2 visits and they kept it in the shop for a total of 3 days until the realized there was a huge air bubble It was very annoying that these little repairs take so many visits and time to be repaired Every now and then my SOS doesnt work which causes my bluetooth to malfunction Other than that the car drives well and I still like the slick look
0,Traded in my 4Runner for a 2007 Type S Great car Smooth and powerful acceleration handling and braking are superb I drive 6070 miles a day mostly highway I used to hate driving to work now its the best part of my day Great all around car especially considering the cost I get 2526 MPG This car is best used as a highway cruiser If you need an around town car look elsewhere This thing wants to go fast
1,I am very happy with my car Its fast and fun and zippy just like I had hoped it would be I am actually shocked that I havent gotten a ticket yet knock on wood It doesnt feel like Im going that fast but before I know it Im pushing 90 It was a pleasure driving an hour and a half each way to Palm Springs for a weekend except for the seats made my back sore I guess I have gotten used to it though because I dont have that problem anymore I highly recommend this car It gets a lot of looks but its not so flashy that I feel uncomfortable
0,Very reliable fun and peppy car to drive Nice stereo The front end torque is something I really have to stay conscious of  I end up all over the road squealing tires if I try to gun it Also need to exchange low profile tires for winter tires in New England or I will not be able to navigate in the snow  I spent most of my first winter at the bottom of my driveway and I bent a  dollar400 alloy rim Goes out of alignment very easily again NE has pot holes TLS very close to ground bottoming out can be an issue I think I will keep it but get an SUV for winter
1,I own a BMW 328 convertible 07 in 2 months it been sent to dealer 3 times First problem was brake warning second times it has same problemThird timeboth rear power windows brokenhave to order partsand then shift warning problemparts ordered is in back orderThis car is just a piece of junksit is a waste of money and timeNot only thatit is frustrated tooI feel nervous every time hearing alarm warning soundMy car still sitting at dealer now waiting for partsI will get rid of this BMW car as soon as possible and never BMW again
0,Our TL had a driver door rattle Took dealer 4 hours to find problem and fix The mirror was was hitting something inside the door and they put extra padding to fix All warranty Highway mileage is excellent for size and power Likes to drive fast to get best mileage To turn off AC  display must say AC OFF  not blank  you will get 510 percent better mileage Hands Free  Although when moving  the road noise interferes with its operation
1,Looked at the Acura TL 07 Camry Sport Avalon Limited Jaguar Volvo S80 and S60 No comparison when talking about cost of ownership and performance I would opt for the sport package with the 17 inch wheels I will use this car as a third car so I dont have to take my Yukon XL Denali on errands Mom of three
0,Having happily owned Hondas including Civics Accords PassportsCRVs and S2000s since 1985 I really was eager to enter the luxury sport sedan market What a treat this car has been It moves like its on rails accelerates quickly moves accurately wherever you point it On lengthy trips my wife is able to nap leaving me to enjoy the driving experience No problems no complaints with the exception of the premium gas requirement which I was aware of from the beginning If youre gonna play ya gotta pay
1,I had Infiniti G35 before and hesitated getting a BMW because of poor reliability track record of any new BMW models The car looks beautiful and drives well so I listened to recommendations and bought the 335 hardtop convertible In the 2nd week the hardtop started to slam down when closing and doesnt tighten I took it back and its been 4 days and I still dont have my car back Comfort access features navigation and iDrive also have some bugs While I like the car when its working right I dont think its worth the hassle Its been the worst experience with any car purchase across the board
0,I have always dreamed of getting an Acura ever since a friend of mine let me drive his This car has such a great takeoff and is gorgeous I do however hear rattling in the door Sometimes it is hard to make a uturn well I love the navi the surround sound HF links I am not aware of the gas light coming on because I try to fill up at half tank I do wish that they would make it run with regular unleaded especially now with gas prices so high Allinall I think the 2007 Acura TL is the a blessing
1,This car is ridiculous Ive only had it for 3 and 12 weeks and Ive already put 2500 miles on it including a 1200 mile round trip to Jersey But this is the fastest car Ive ever driven in From the way it picks up from a dead start with all that torque to the way it handles SHARP turns and it has a CRAZY mid range punch To attest to the fact its a fast car the BMW M5 which is a 500 HP V10 only beat this car in the 14 mile by 110 of a second I love this car and could go on forever about it
0,I love this car and was dreaming about it for more than 4 years Now that I have it its so fun to drive it Wish it gave better fuel economy but if you can pay for the car you can pay for the gas I wish it had just a little more power when I hit the gas Its quick no doubt but could be quicker from the getgo
1,I previously owned a Chrysler Sebring convertible for ten years For me to say that this car drives MUCH better would be an understatement I tested this and the IS 250 and although there is nothing bad about the Lexus the BMW is just a little better in every way Exterior look interior design and drivability I am not a track driver and the performance package in my opinion is unnecessary if driving isnt your hobby The standard suspension and steering is very enjoyable If you take long trips and have the performance suspension pray that they just paved the roads Otherwise youll feel every bump dip and stone on the road All in all the BMW is just a great car Worth every penny
0,This is more of a performance car than luxury If you are looking for something that is quiet and very comfortable you should go for the RL from Acura or BMW 5 series or any car in that range The suspension on this car is more towards handling than comfort so its a little tougher than what you expect from a luxury car Dont get me wrong the car is brilliant with the wide tires it has a lot more grip which increases stability and handling Overall a great performance car
1,I have had six straight BMWs and havent owned anything else for 20 some years My problem is the run flat tires The vehicle handling was acceptable when I purchased it but has gone steadly down hill The dealer is resisting doing anything about it but the noise is gotten to be unacceptable My air pressure sensor has come on twice and after checking the tires the pressure is within acceptable limits Something wrong here and its definitely the tires Dont take a chance on these tires My experience proves it Dont accept the run flats
0,Subtle sporty looks combined with a powerplant befitting Hondas no boring drives slogan The manufacturers strong credentials and this cars appeal made me giveup my beloved Accord EX V6 1998 good lowprofile tires With the TypeS I got a faster safer and more luxurious car Normal driving is smooth but floor it and WOW Which brings me to the torque steer issue not a problem unless you want a race car I put the VSA vehicle stability assist system of the TypeS through a reallife test on an icy parking lot this winter and at 80km it kept the car on track by activating alternatively the rear brakes when I steered heavily in an attempt to get it to skid Canadianwinter approved
1,I was determined to buy an Acura TL or a G35 and did not even consider the 328i I had been already been driving a 2001 325i and loved it I ended up test driving all three cars TL G35 328i The 328i is just head and shoulders more elegant and sporty inside and out Yes price is significant however that is up to each individual to determine if it was worth it I love the car It drives like no other and the sports mode is very fast Interior space is not bad and the trunk is not bad
0,Best car Ive had Makes you wanna drive for the sake of doing it Good acceleration can throw you back in the seat Comfy front seats rear is a little bit tight Looks AMAZING clean Speaker cover in the dash rattles a tiny bit after a year Had to get the door latch fixed but thats it so far
1,Second BMW first was 03 325xi first was wonderful and this is much better Engine in different league even handling surprisingly better Recent ice storms and heavy snow removed any doubts whether AWD again worth mileage penalty BTW these cars get worse mileage intown but better highway than EPA ratings as did 325xi Runflats Contis not Bridgestones smoother than ratings led me to expect
0,This is my first TL and unfortunately will be my last The engine pings and Ive used nothing but 93 octane fuel
1,Just picked up my new 328xi a week ago and cannot say enough good things about it Would have gotten the 335 but it was not available in AWD yet Engine is great and extremely fast It came down to the Audi S4 Mercedes E350 Infiniti G35x and Infiniti M35x and by far the BMW drove the best and was the best value I am leasing it for 24 months but very confident I will be buying it out at the end of the lease
0,Aside from the nice appearance this car has been a grave disappointment I test drove the TL on a nice flat road But in the real world when I am accelerating over an uneven surface the wobbliness of front wheel drive become painfully apparent especially with 286HP I have had persistent issues with cabin noise  there are constant creaks when going over bumpy roads  it makes the car sound cheap I had a defective starter which needed replacement The nav system is not very smart The tranny had issues with the 3rd gear that needed fixing Most importantly the 35L engine is prone to pinging
1,I ordered this car and waited a few months for it When I finally got it it began to fall apart immediately The gas tank had air in it that a man at the gas station released for me in order to fill the tank more than halfway The heat did not work at all It was in for service 4 days after I got it and had to have the radiator replaced The cupholder broke the first time it was used The car looks and drives beautifullly but is not put together with the quality I expected from BMW
0,My third Type S and the best one to date as a matter of fact it is the best car i have ever owned
1,I love this car inside and out The only flaws are that the shifter has a slightly long throw but that can be easily replaced aftermarket the seat belt pusher is flimsy and weak and the iDrive is just kind of annoying but nothing that isnt worth not getting the car Vishnus XEDE is also a very welcomed mod opens up a lot of the cars true power
0,Had the car for a year now its a huge step up from the Accord I was previously driving Its a great deal the competition costs thousands more for the same features Gas mileage is great too on a 500 mile road trip I averaged 34 MPG This car isnt for everyone though Those looking for the ultimate sports sedan think BMW minded buyers will say its FWD and not sporty enough Those wanting a cushy serene ride think Lexus ES will say its too sporty and has too much road noise You cant please everyone but for me this car is what I consider to be an ideal blend of everything It doesnt excel at any one particular thing but does everything very well
1,I traded in a vette for this car and I dont regret it at all Best car Ive ever owned No maintenance issues ONLY CAVEAT BUY THE ROAD HAZARD INSURANCE FOR THE RUNFLATS If you get the sport package low profile tires it will pay for itself very quickly 
0,Went from a 2001 Chrysler Concorde to this caramazing difference Wanted something sporty coming off of the big gasguzzling luxury car with no power Love merging onto a highway and blowing everyone away Mechanic friend was very impressed by it Dont think I could find another car this size I would love as much I am fortunate to not be experiencing the rattling or problems others are having
1,My first BMW had owned Mazdaspeed6 Infiniti G20 Very handsome car inside and out premium materials inside Loved it  until driving over NJ potholes On 3 separate occasions I hit a modest not gigantic pothole and my can of soda went flying out of the holder hit the ceiling then fell to the floor spilling on the carpet Incredibly frustrating ride is way too stiff During service at BMW dealer I mentioned this to the manager He told me it was a very common complaint with the new generation coupe This was originally a  dollar46k car which I got for a steal at  dollar32k with 18k miles Despite my great deal I sold the car after 4 months of ownership I couldnt drive it on NJ roads
0,Over the last 4800 miles the computer tells me Im averaging 28MPG Nothing wrong with that Getting a fuel warning at 13 gallons is annoying dealer tells me it cant be fixed Otherwise this is a great car  wonderful integration of electronic and mechanical bits thoughtfully engineered quick and comfortable This is my fourth Acura 2 TLs 2 MDXs and Ive never been left by the side of the road something my BMWowning friends cant say Plus my TL will suck the doors off a 528 sounds just as good doing it and costs 10 grand less similarly equipped
1,Ill start w what I dont like the cup holders Handling is pretty stiff which I enjoy since I get a sportier drive but drinks in cup holder go splashing around when I make a sharp turn Second theres a blind spot on the drivers side and no matter how I angle my mirrors or slightly cock my head to check for cars there have been a few close calls My car now has a screeching noise driving at 1035 mph The service dept says if they cant hear it they cant fix it I love driving the car but thankfully my lease is almost up because I would be wary about keeping it past its warranty
0,If God had created the perfect car he would have created the Acura TL TypeS This car is one serious piece of machinery It is a triple threat all the safety of a Honda all the power of a sports car and the design to kill for It is the perfect culmination of attributes looked for in sport sedan Also this car gets incredible fuel economy for being a 35L V6 The 5th gear overdrive enables the TL to cruise at 75 mph only spinning a mere 2100 rpms thats impressive by any standards The average mileage at 75 mph with the AC cranked up and the lights and radio on is an incredible 35 mpg This car is a hands down winner in all categories of sports sedan
1,Ive had my 328xi for a few weeks now Ive been a loyal X5 driver 3 of them over the past 10 years I decided to get better gas mileage and cheaper car payment but didnt want to sacrifice BMW ride Ive not been disappointed The car is fun to drive and handles great Even though it doesnt have the high sight lines of the SUV the coupes big doors actually give you a wider field of view Im tall so I sit back far from the wheel so even in the X5 I could see the side posts in my blind spot The car is light so the power of the smaller engine feels stroner than the X5 Sure theres less room all around  but with the seats folded down it carries a nice load
0,Best car up to date Good driving experiences great leg room
1,Rarely in life do I find something that actually exceeds my expectations which were quite lofty to begin with as this was my mid life post divorce crisis car I waited for my whole life I have had problems with the electronics already namely the speedo which reads WAY too high some tire monitor and other sensors that mysteriously appear and disappear and an overwhelming heat coming from the foot area I had been driving it incredibly hard on some world renowned roads and had to have the air on full on the floor in 50 degree temps to NOT sweat BUT this car is fantastic EVERY TIME I get in it I feel great It is the best driving quickest car I have ever been in Period
0,Most luxurious sedan for this price range Very satisfied with the interior qualities compared to other competitors
1,Tested the IS 350 G35 Acura TL and nothing comes close With 4 years and 50k miles of worry free driving you cant beat this Since BMW stopped making the 4 door M3 Ive had to wait for this car to come out and Im very happy that I did
0,If you like sporty and a cockpit like a jet you will love this car This is my 3rd Acura and the best one yet I added 18 wheels and I have the navigation system as well I am still trying to figure out all that this car can do You have to test drive this one
1,I had driven a 330xi for the past 6 years and loved the car It had excellent acceleration and a great feel The new 328xi is supposed to have more torque and horsepower but has absolutely no acceleration The car is slow from standing to 1st and lags from 1st to 2nd It bucks on me when going up a hill I can feel the slow shifting in the low gears and when I make a right or left turn from a stopping position the car haltingly moves I am shocked at the lack of responsiveness of this car I dont know whether I have a bad model or whether this car is simply grossly underpowered
0,Had an 01 CL and traded in for a comfortable 4 door in August Went for the more affordable Honda Accord EXL V6 and couldnt get past what I loved about the Acuras performance handling craftmanship Very easy to go from Honda to Acura not easy to go from Acura to Honda Im hooked Went to Acura and traded the 07 Accord for the 07 TLType S and dont understand what I was thinking in August
1,Ive been in the car business for ten years and have yet to experience a car that delivers on style comfort quality and performance as this car does Bought one for my wife feeling at the time kind of pricey for 3 series but have to admit that this car lives up to all BMW claims
0,This car is great I had a 2006 BMW 5 series and this car great compared to its rivals The interior has a very specious more room  The music system and navi is top of the line and the seats are very comfortable Belive me this car is very fun to drive
1,This car is everything wonderful about a BMW taken to an incredible level The driving experience alone is a value at this price and its wrapped in what is finally a slam dunk iteration of the new Bangle styling I can find a few ridiculously picky flaws with the interior but what I cant find is any other car Id rather have south of a  dollar60K Cayman S Judging from the stares and attention this car garners Im not the only one
0,After one month of ownership all is fantastic Amazing automobile with no issues to this point Taking some time to learn all of the systems capabilities but WOW Gas mileage is getting better with each mile
1,This twin turbo is very quiet yet powerful Seats are extremely comfy with sport package and rides very decently for sp and runflats Looks killer in black lots of techno wizardry Very large trunk and great cruising range of about 450 miles Build quality great reliability unknown long term because of new model status A lot of car for the money
0,I got my TL Type S July 07 It has 3500 miles on it and love it Its gorgeous I am very comfortable in it although I am not very big My husband is not as comfortable but hes tall I love the power and the handling that this car offers Step on it and go I like the feel of the road and this car has that My kids are comfortable in the back The sound system is great I love the back up camera   and the ipod plug I do have a rattle on the back trunk lid part where the speakers are Will have them check it at my first service I did have to replace one of the tires because I hit a pothole  dollar240 Tire guy told me the low profile tires are horrible They look cool tho So far very happy
1,Nothing but a headache Its been to the dealer 4x for the same problem stalling stalling stalling and stalling Piece of junk  bought it brand new barely 13K miles I hope BMW will see this take your car and give me my money Its now scheduled to go another appointment on the same problem stalling squeaking loud thug when backing up put on manual mode and wont default to 1st gear at full stop When will BMW take care of the stalling My confidence on this car is below zero Never never never will buy another BMW unsafe car
0,This car has about as much fun as you do It corners nimble and stays on line in the direction it is pointed The suspension gets into front and rear tires when tight cornering and launches the car out of the turns into the straights with positive acceleration pushing you back into the seat
1,Bought a pretty standard issue 07 328i sedan with heated seats iPod and auto everything else standard Have owned it for 14 months havent had any problems even despite my hesitation in waiting almost 138k to get an oil change Close to 16k now Average about 21 mpg with 70 percent city30 percent hwy and get over 32mpg in pure hwy Except for the fact that its a little expensive for what it is I am thrilled with the driving dynamics reliability and quality of the car If you can afford it go for it you wont be disappointed I didnt get the Sport Package but wish I had  the wheels and seats are awesome
0,This car is great I had a 2004 Infiniti G35 and this car tops it by far The interior has more room I am 64 I have plenty of head room and ample leg room The stereo and nav is top notch And the seats are very supportive and comfortable The power on the Type S is very solid Though one thing I miss is the rear wheel drive on the G35 But besides that this car is very fun to drive
1,I wanted to try the BMW and was impressed with the 335i advertised horsepower and torque But I didnt really notice the turbo lag on the test drive when I bought the car Now 2 years later I cant wait to turn this vehicle in It has been back to the dealer 3 times for performance and I am always told this is normal It is extremely irritating and dangerous Try to pull out in traffic or try to go when it is your turn at a 4 way stop and you will have a one second delay from the time you hit the gas until it goes Then it jerks as the traction control goes on and off I have had the brake sensors replaced and the steering column Stay away from this car Poor quality and performance
0,Bought this car because of its design and reliability The second week I had ignition problem which was fixed by the dealer The car drives well and I feel very secure behind the wheel But the squeaks and the little noises drive me crazy With every additional mile the noises increase exponentially The noise problem is present in every heavy car I had a GS before which was no stranger to the constant sounds but the noises are profoundly present in this car more than others I would think again before buying this car again
1,I bought 335XI with all the options car has been a blast to drive however in May 2008 my engine light came on took it to the dealership Dealership had the car for 3 weeks after replacing both turbos and numerous other parts I got the car back but the mechanic did not know what caused the original failure I started googling 335Xi twin turbo failures there is a real problem with these cars overheating into limp mode especially cars that dont have oil coolers installed which mine did not I called BMW of North America 3 different times and got the same response though I bought the 335XI with all options since I had 17 instead of 18 wheels I was not eligible for the oil cooler kit
0,Tried all the competition and chose this car for its the most balanced auto in terms of price quality engine transmission power options etc Nice car no doubt
1,After almost 2 years behind the wheel I have to say new exterior design is best in its class Most people will say the best thing about the 335i is the power but I have to add that its brakes are equally as superb The twinturbo engine gives 060 mph in less than 5 seconds then you realize you are way above the speed limit Rear seating lacks leg room but any who buys the 3series coupe for its leg room Ive heard enough complaints out there about the infamous iDrive but who cares if you can simply use your voice to control everything I dont recommend getting the beige interior as it gets dirty too easily All in all this is one fine piece of German engineering 7 out of 10 overall
0,Fast and stylish great interior and sound system
1,The Bridgestone runflats are a definite fault for my 2007 328i sedan   noisy premature wear at 15K miles overall poor performance BMW should make buyers aware of the replacement before  dollar20000 halfprice discount why so secretive but even more so should get rid of them altogether Very poor choice for a luxury sedan BMW should listen to their consumers and ditch the RFTs This is my third 3 series though the first with RFTs but will be my last if BMW sticks with the runflats Other than this one complaint I love the car Considering putting regular radials on it and putting a compact sparejack in the trunk
0,After 10 yrs and 145000 mi I sold my 528 BMW for a TL First things first IMO the BMW E39 is superior to the TL in all dynamic driving categories period But having said that the TL is still a very fine car Reasonably quick stylish comfortable quiet no rattles here and good gas mileage got almost 31 mpg on our last trip But the TL does have issues First is the transmission under normal everyday driving its flawless but try some spirited driving and its slow to kick down and the computer gets confused hunting for the right gear Second is the suspension its jittery and on less than smooth roads the front will bounce this is not a good thing especially in a sports sedan
1,What a disappointment this vehicle has been I now have 22000 miles on this car and it had to have the rear differential changed the seats had to be repainted whiplash on take off and various other issues Cant lemon law this vehicle because it hasnt been in the shop enough You would think when a large component like the differential going they BMW would step up and recognize the actual defect
0,11890 miles into my TL TypeS Automatic Interior rattles are driving me nuts They come out of nowhere Interior does scratch very easily Car squeaks Suspension or something from underneath the car Not sure but getting it checked out I think its the suspension Seat memory settings dont always work correctly All station presets vanished on me a few times and came back the next day Ghosts Other than that the car is awesome Compliments everywhere Real rocketship 286 HP Hwy I am getting 29 MPG Overall AVG 23 MPG I think thats pretty good
1,Where shall I start I park my car in the garage and never lock it one day I went out opened the passenger door to get something closed it The next morning the battery was dead When you open the passenger door the headlights dont go back out I have had about 4 sets of tires on the front when you hit a pothole it feels like you were in an accident Also 1 new set of rims Engine performance is great Navigation is a mess The bluetooth works really well and the AWD system is flawless
0,I had a 2003 Type S and loved that cars ride so thought that in purchasing the 2007 Type S Id be just as pleased The new Type S has unbelieveable power and acceleration and handles like a nimble sport car All in all a very exciting and sporty ride The sporty suspension does make the ride a little harsh Almost every imperfection in the road gets transmitted through the steering wheel The comfort is great and I love the navigation system and telematics However the interior rattles drive me crazy No excuse for a luxury sport sedan of Acuras caliber to have this problem
1,Notwithstanding the following the 328 Touring is great automobile but in the hopes that these comments may come to BMWs attention here are five criticisms 1 the rear hatch requires some effort to open 2 the direction signal is overly electronic and can miss the off position 3 the radio control is based on some old DOS format and is awkward to change from cd to tuner 4 the car produces a large clunk over potholes 5 the transmission spends so much time seeking gas savings its slow to down shift and the sport mode is way too nervous These should be all easy to correct But perhaps most disturbing is that the cars ride is drifting towards that of Lexus and away from BMW
0,When I was looking for a new car I compared the G35 IS 250 Toyota Avalon and the TL with each other The thing I really liked best was that the things I really wanted multiCD changer moonroof leather all come standard with the TL I have had the car now for 3 months and I am really enjoying driving it Although not as much horsepower as the SType it is the most powerful car I have owned Im surprised I have not been pulled over yet This is the first car I have owned that I have hit 100 MPH with I love the interior of the car with the black leather pretty much throughout I like having the audio controls on the steering wheel
1,Looked for a compact car for a couple of years to replace my Lexus ES Considered the Lexus IS but the interior is too cramped even though it drove well and I loved my old Lexus have had three Bought Merc C Class and was disappointed This is the first BMW I have owned and never really considered one before this model because they just didnt ring any bells Drove one on the way to buy another updated Merc C class at Xmas and was smitten The car is great and I am really pleased with it and very very surprised at how good it is The only disappointment and its major is the way the Polish Bridgestone run flat tyres perform and ride Awful
0,I had been driving a Volvo S60 and had nothing but problems with it and was debating between TL and BMW 328 My buddy went with BMW and I went with TL I made the right choice Although it does not handle quite as sporty as the BMW it will go when you need it to go The everything standard interior is where it blows away the competition especially the BMW Compare standard package on a TL and then add them as options to everything else in its class and money makes it an easy decision It is roomy the sound system is great and all controls are very easy to use If this is the way Acura makes all its cars I will be loyal for a long time
1,I have had 2007 335cic for a year now The hardtop has been repaired once The engine malfunctioned and was in the service dept for 2 weeks for repair Seat belt didnt retract and had to be replaced iDrive freezes up periodically and BMW service dept cant fix it because they couldnt reproduce the same problem Run flat tires are expensive short lasting and dont handle well compare with regular tires
0,I have owned previous Acura TLs 2 and was very happy to see Honda bring back the TypeS this year The impressive thing about this car is the level of features added from older versions The fact that there are no options needed or available tells it all The only thing I added was the iPod connection The cars handling and performance is what makes it fun to drive They didnt just add the RL engine they did a great job tuning the suspension to really use the additional HP This is probably the best buy out there right now when you consider all of the standard features the fun to drive quotient and the price you pay Kudos to Acura
1,Loved BMW since a little kid finally got one Even entry level 328i has plenty of power and sticks to the road like glue Many people warned me that they dont handle well in snowice but I found it to be better than any car Ive ever had including front wheel drives I couldnt make it skid when I tried Glad I didnt go for the x option unnecessary The car is quality through and through Wish I had an autobahn to really run it May do European delivery next time
0,This car is an excellent car They handle well drive wonderfully and are just great all around I traded in a 2005 mustang for the Acura and it suprised me with speed comfort and looks I love Acura
1,I bought the car in 507 The hardtop has been fixed once The seatbelt metal clip put a few dents and scratches on the inside of drivers door Driver seat is uncomfortable despite adjustment Run flat tires are heavy and dont perform so well No room for spare tire iDrive freezes up occasionally and service dept cant duplicate it and therefore they cant fix it Engine malfunction reduced power came on at 21000 miles in 10 months now pending repair
0,I first noticed theTL for its super sharp looks It looks and drives like a very well equipped sports sedan rather than a rich persons silvermetallic luxury car I read all very favorable reviews and then I test drove it I loved driving it I liked how Acura put together such a great handling well performing excellently equipped car in one decently priced and sharp looking package I like that the car does not look too showy but that you get the real pleasure from it by actually driving it and from all of the fantastic features packed with it I have automatic but I drive it on sportshift It absolutely feels like the manual shifter
1,Two words stupid fast A few bugs from the getgo difficulty starting iPod integration but overall very pleased with the 335 It is more spacious than my 05 330 Fuel economy is not quite what I expect but I cant complain with 300 horses under the hood and expect it will get better as everything gets broken in
0,I went with Acura because of their known reliability and my experience with Hondas I test drove Acuras that were 35 years old before this to see how they hold up and was very impressed Im hoping mine will hold up and ride the way the used ones I drove did After looking at Infiniti Lexus and BMW I went with Acura for their resale value and the fact that you get more for your money So far no regrets I love the way people stare at my car at lights and in parking lots
1,Since my purchase I have had no remorse in my choosing the 335xi  the car is a dream in handling and response I like having the added safety of all wheel drive on wet pavement The iDrive was a little difficult to learn at first but now I can easily and safely maneuver and the voice commands also work without problems The gas mileage between highway and city is averaging about 21 mpg
0,Bought the TL for overall value It has a nice ride but I wish that the shifting were a bit smoother Love the exterior design The car has a lot of features and the switches and controls seem to be all in the right places except for the MP3 plug which is inside the armrest console making it awkward to control Nice sound system and easy to use navi system Heard about rattling problem with hondasacuras but havent noticed it  lucky for a nice stereo system so ill just crank it up The low fuel warning is a bit annoying since it comes on with 4 gallons to go Overall though Im pretty happy with the car so far
1,BlkBlk sportpremnavipod This is one of the most fun cars to drive that Ive owned It has amazing torque and sticks to corners without roll Im a previous 5 series owner so it feels a little cramped inside Extremely disappointed with BMW as the vehicle left me on the expressway with only 480 miles on it and the SOS service was horrible The vehicle connected well with the call service however the AAA srvc provider BMW uses did not pick up my car for 4 hours and it was 100 degrees in Atl Complained to BMW NA but they didnt care Problem was the belts broke and the car lost all power Gas mileage is good for a 300 hp car avg 225 mpg Would get 535i next time for space
0,I have been driving a 1999 Acura TL with 230000 miles Great car reliable high performance comfortable Went same place for a replacement kids get old car still running great Wish it had darker interior better rear visibility more comfortable seat for shorter driver 53 and better gas mileage but cant fault anything else Coworkers very envious Love the sound system navigation maintenance features
1,My 328xi has the premium sport and cold weather packages and it is also a manual Its a great car The run flat tires are hard for Michigan roads but Ive had no problems otherwise The accelerator pedal electronic I suspect is a bit dead but the rest of the controls are great There is no ontheroad performance hit compared to the sedan or coupe I considered and test drove them all
0,I was mocked by coworkers for having a soccer mom car Test drove Lexus IS 250 and BMW 3 Series and while the latter two had great reviews and drove well the TL hands down feels more like it For being a Honda it drove like a champ I guess I got my mojo back with this ride
1,My previous car was a 2001 AUDI A6 42 pearl color I loved it and thought there was no match I was wrong The BMW 335xi is a great car with plenty of power and looks I settled for a Titanium Silver with all of the trimmings Premium Sport etc Good MPG 2627 highway will be saving me a little cash too For those shopping dont short change yourself be sure to get the premium package at minimum youll want to sleep in your car
0,I bought Type S in Feb 2007 The cars engine is great acceleration is superb looks are great However interior material quality is one of the worst I have seen in new cars Too much rattling I had a rattling sound coming from behind steering wheel and even the dealer couldnt figure it out More rattle from the middle by cup holder If the windows are down they rattle as if some screws are loose in the door panel I am seriously thinking about trading it in I have been a Acura fan for years but this TL Type S experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and probably never go back to Acura
1,I just purchase my first BMW 2007 550i I test drove the 528 and did not like the lack of power The 550i is a BEAST and is a dream to drive I cant stay home I take the longest way home and the acceleration is orgasmic I will never drive another car other than a BMW Worth every penny Not sure what my gas mileage will be yet but so far not bad for a V8 engine
0,I test drove the BMW 335i coupe Lexus ES 350 and this car Loved the balance in this car and costs a lot less than the BMW While not as solid in handling and performance as the BMW the Acura TLS has more creature comforts and almost as good handling for a lot less money than the BMW The Lexus was great but not very solid at handling as the Acura TL
1,Just got a CPO with 28K miles Drives like a dream I opted for the sport pkg with no regrets The only glaring disappointment was the Logic 7 Sound system which leaves a lot to be desired My Civic SI factory upgrade system was better For a lux car that retails for 60k new the Logics 7 system should rival Acura but falls far short on fidelity plus a boomy bass Too bad for such a quiet car
0,This car has all the luxury features that are in similar offerings like Lexus MB Cadillac etal but also has performance to go with it Yes you can purchase a Bimmer but would you get all the standard features of this vehicle for the same price No Just returned from a 800 miles road trip and the car returned 31 miles per gallon Excellent for a brand new car usually it takes time for the engine to break in and get the advertised figures on the window sticker
1,There is much to like about this car Performance styling and reliability It also seems to maintain value There are some frustrating features on the car  the iDrive takes some getting used to Something that should be simple like tuning the radio switching from CD to radio even the climate control has been in my opinion overengineered Often multiple steps are required to perform a function that could be more easily done with the turn of a knob The sun roof is very noisy after the sale the rep said all 5Series have excessive wind noise when closed I usually just keep the interior cover closed to avoid the noise Interior cabin storage is nonexistent but the trunk is large
0,For those who want amazing practicality of a midsize outstanding lux room like a fully equipped M35X and very great performance look no further For driving dynamics I am pro Infiniti I drove the TL type S and compared to the G the type S has less throttle sensitivity but its more technologically sound spacious and refined 060 is about 6 sec flat and wfwd you can drive in the snow wo too much fuss It comes standard fully equipped handling and composure is great while keeping cabin quiet Some say the ride and torque steer is rough but I not experienced such a thing in this vehicle Save yourself 15000 and get a type s it feels like it should be worth 55K
1,I purchased my 2007 530i new 2 years ago I traded my 2004 530i in when I reached 45K miles I have not been disappointed with either of these cars The handling comfort and power are great I test drove a 2004 525 when I was first looking because the dealer had one with the Sport Package but I chose the larger engine and didnt regret my choice The 50K no charge warranty is great but honestly the dealer makes things up so they can fix my car eg change the wiper blades etc I have not had any real issues with my cars
0,I love the car if youre looking for a quiet ride this is not the car for you Interior is poorly built and there is much rattling Outside drivers mirror bangs on something center speaker rattles over bumps dashboard made of plastic rattles over bumps passengers headrest makes a sound like someone is chewing gum in your ear Also if you test drive the car leave the window open and keep your ears keen to the metal banging that happens underneath the car when hitting bumps at over 30mph My car suffers from this and the 2 TL loaners that ive received so far also did this Annoying but I was told its normal and not much can be done about it Performance design all good
1,Sadly our first BMW only went 20K before being involved in a drivers front end collision last week Damage was so severe the car was totaled It did its job however as the front door and side curtain air bags all deployed and kept the wife protected with no major issues BMW Assist was calling the car within seconds of the accident as well as calling the police Overall it was a well built car and we had no major problems with it The brake issue I mentioned in my previous posting never returned We are now looking at an 08 528i or 535i with the turbo The 07 held its value fairly well In the 18 months we owned the car the value dropped 28 percent
0,We were looking for a new car for my wifes commute and our weekends something suitable for Wisconsin winters but attractive and sporty No more minivans or SUVs  been doing that for years with kids Came down to the BMW 328xi and the Acura ultimately we decided to go with a fully loaded Acura for less money vs a very basic BMW with no leather powerheated seats etc We get lots of looks on the road  no Acura dealer for 100 miles so its also unique here So far she loves it
1,Overall the car is great This was our first BMW Nice looks nice interior comforts Very nice leather My only complaint so far is with the brakes An annoying squeak develops when the front brakes get the slightest amount of dust on them I did not expect this from a  dollar50K car Also when I have the steering wheel and seat in a position I like I cannot see the upper portion of the speedometer We are happy with the car The ride is amazing At high speeds in the rain it handles very well Recently got a road force balance on the tires and that made the ride much better We purchased the car in black I would not own another in black Hard to keep clean
0,Like the looks of the car and the nav features are great The transmission is clunky especially downshifting into 1st gear and I was hoping that it would break in more The seat is not as comfortable as my Volvo S60 but good leg and head room Solidly constructed  brakes and handles well Like the safety features Nice car but will most likely go Infiniti or Lexus next time for the added comforts
1,This is my 9th BMW and I am pleased that BMWs have not lost their edge Great handling adequate power I miss the torque from the MB E500 I had very good build quality The car is a roomy 4 door sports car The 255 BHP 6 is good but torque is a little low and you tend to be aware that the 6 speed auto is being used rather a lot I get a little hesitation when I make a sudden demand for acceleration which can be a little disconcerting Sports package worth the money for the contour seats alone They are the most comfortable seats in the business Fuel economy is excellent Superb car worthy of the BMW name Just annoyed that BMW introduced the 300 BHP engine just after I purchased my car
0,I owned an 04 TL and an 05 RL I traded that RL on a G35 coupe Loved the G35 but really missed the Acura product So this past June 25th I walked into an Acura dealership and negotiated a deal on a 07 TL type S A lot of the bells and whistles of the RL faster and more stable than the TL How can you go wrong Not as fast as the G35 but so much more refined and a pleasure to drive
1,One of best purchase experiences of many cars over 40 years of driving Car has its problems mostly electrical Especially iDrive is a bad idea Poor execution Drivers seat adjusts forward and up on its own Screen display blanks iDrive inoperable no GPS no radio no access to system functions or warnings Reprogrammed multiple times reverts to same problems in short time Electronic key replaced 3 times in attempts to cure Comfort Access issue Nothing
0,This is Acura number 4 for me These car are incredibly reliable and great to own The TL comes with virtually every option that all of the competition puts into pricey packages I put in a lot of miles every year and comfort is a priority The TL is extremely driverpassenger friendly The ride is smooth and the shifting is seamless Navigation and voice activated system is very good No more fumbling for phone or headset since everything is handsfree and controlled from steering wheel Design is pretty conservative but not bad Mileage is better than last TL even with more horsepower Currently I get about 28 mpg hwy and 25 overall
1,I love my new 2007 525i I previously had a 2004 325i and this one is just much more roomier and comfortable and I love the Black Sapphire exterior with sand color interior combination I do have a little difficulty with the I controller but Im sure Ill get the swing of it Car drives great
0,I previously owned an 05 TL and told the dealer Id buy a new one when they dropped the RLs engine in it Got a call went down and test drove the TLS Loved it from the beginning The suspension with the standard tires is much more compliant but still has enough firmess for great handling My 05s suspension used to crash over road imperfections and was stiff I found the TLS to be much more refined with plenty of HPtorque with little torque steer I looked at Infinitis M45 and at BMWs 5 series both are overpriced compared to the features on the TLS
1,Now in the shop for the fourth time to fix the apparently unfixable Sirius satellite radio entire radio failed once engine valve clatter and transmission clunk is annoying but not yet troublesome Great car otherwise but clearly not up to manufacturing and reliability standards of Lexus Acura and the other Pacific Rim manufacturers whose cars I have owned in the past Even more troubelsome than the two Mercedes we recently owned
0,I have had the TLS for a week now and I love it Im sure a sports car purist would find plenty to gripe about but its NOT a sports car its a sporty sedan And as a sporty sedan the TLS excels The engine is excellent with lots of low end torque and a wide power band Handling is crisp but will not rattle your teeth loose The interior is very well laid out quiet and comfortable All in all its as near perfect as a car can get
1,Having owned an E430 4matic and Audi A8L prior to this Im getting used to the smaller car The iDrive system is terrible compared to MMI of Audi Acceleration is a bit slow but handling is awesome in all weather conditions Interior finish is a bit cheap with too much vinyl and tacky plastic buttons for this pricepoint Fold down rear seats Bluetooth and headup display are nice features Getting 1920 mpgs driving around northern NJ I look forward to 7 series xi next time
0,This is a great buy for an entrylevel luxury car It has great HP easy steering and looks great I opted for the 19 Acura chrome wheels and chose the red exterior for a more feminine look It has been called a sexy car by many who have seen it and I must agree However I think the carbon grey or the black is very handsome You will love the sound of the exhaust and find yourself wondering if theres a V8 in there Also no more second guessing your reverseparking skills due to the fancy back up camera
1,Love the car when it is not in the shopPurchased an 07 model in May 06 Car has 6000 mi and has been in the shop 40 days First it had a steering angle sensor problem took 30 days for part to come in Then a recall for shock absorbers Then 3 trips for bluetooth problems and sunroof After that had programming problem with air conditioner Car is only 5 MONTHS OLD
0,I test drove BMW 330i Lexus IS 350 Lexus ES 350 and Acura TL I eventually decided to get TL Ive had my Acura for a month now I often have to resist the urge to just drive it for fun For those of you who are still searching out there buy an Acura and you will not regret it
1,My first BMW the car just feels a lot more solid than any other vehicle I have ever owned lexus nissan z acura Honda VW Jeep It seems as though a lot of attention was paid to the driver when they designed the 5 My only complaint is the lack of power in the 525i I guess its my own fault for getting the 525 instead of the 530 or 545
0,I got the TypeS almost as soon as it came out and didnt see another for months  it is definitely a headturner It cant beat the Infiniti G35x or the Lexus IS 350 in aceleration but it handles great drives smooth and quiet and is absolutely loaded with features I love this car
1,I got my 1st BMW as a birthday gift 10 years ago I LOVED it and didnt want to part with it My husband said that I was long overdue for a new car test drove a few others loved the 525xi My child was 3 weeks old when I was in a head on collision with my old BMW and he slept through it Now I need a little more room and the same safety features this car has it I NEVER thought I would leave an American car but BMW is amazing With these cars you only have to get a new one once every 10 years ENJOY PS my husband has had two 7 series and two X5 We are converts to BMW
0,This car is great for anything and everything It has a very nice exterior design but it is easily overlooked The interior is sporty yet luxurious And sporty is this cars middle name The engine is fun to rev and it has great handling An all around good car
1,IDrive not as bad as many people think With the option to set the buttons on steering to your specific feature is great Otherwise there is no reason to play around with the iDrive while driving
0,I have a 2005 MDX and recently we needed a second car After test driving three different Acura models I chose the TL The car was far superior to the TSX in quality as well and also had a more sleek and mature personality than the RDX Since we have an MDX I opted for a nicer smoother and more sophisticated TL I chose the Sseries to get the manual transmission  lots of fun The car is subtlely aggressive yet practical too My kids fit easily and safely and the gas mileage is AOK 25 mpg mixed cityhwy Love my Acuras
1,Overall is a great car dont get me wrong im been an BMW enthusiast for years but the dealer cant fix the wear of the rear tires on the inside They want me to do alignment and put new set of tires at 22000 miles at my expense Thats the reason i purchased a  dollar80000 car on the first place insane
0,Went from a 2004 BMW 330i 6M to the new TL TypeS 6M and I love it Also tested the G35s 6M 335i and 328i A4 20T Quattro and Lexus IS 350 I was leery about the FWD with 289 horses mated to it but torque steer is minimal and kind of fun and it does not detract from performance This car is more responsive and precise than the BMW was when it came to handing The interior is much more spacious comfortable and userfriendly Glad I made the decision on the Acura
1,The BMW 650i is not what I expected This is NOT a sports car It is an overpriced sporty sedan The manual transmission is awful The navigation system is worse The car handles well for a sedan Acceleration from zero is not great but it does have a great deal of power from 30 mph to 100 mph
0,First and foremost I have to say this car turns heads like no other Ive driven It looks good and sounds even better Ive had the car for less than 2 weeks and cant stop finding reasons to go outside and drive it The quad exhaust has this deep thundering hum when dropping from 3rd to 2nd On the flip side of this with the windows closed on the highway its like sitting in a serene park You almost want to turn down the stereo just so you can here the pindrop silence The back up camera is all you need to reverse and the auto flip mirrors are just an added bonus This car has so many features that I dont even know where to start Love the car and hands down wouldve bought this again
1,This is NOT a sports car It is a sporty twosedan The manual transmission is very disappointing The car corners well but is not very quick 060 mpg However it does well getting on the freeway 3070mph It does not compare very favorably to a 911 Porsche but it competes well with the SL 500 Mercedes
0,As a German Ive driven BMW Mercedes and Audis When I was looking for a sports sedan again I felt I get a lot of value for my  dollar with this Acura TLS I had it for about 1 month now and it fits like a glove drives smooth put the pedal to the metal and it will push you in the drivers seat Very roomy and excellent design Plus Hondas long reliability seems to surpass BMW and Mercedes Also if repairs are needed Honda  Acura is cheaper than BMW
1,The 650 has what BMW calls an inherent characteristic If you drive in manual shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop Imagine your head bobbing back and forth like a doll on the dashboard The vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m1 such as you might in a parking garage looking for a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp and to a lesser extent in automatic The lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at 4 miles per hour BMW states the problem is with the softwareit thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle BMW wont fix the problem Stay away from this vehicle
0,I test drove the new G35 and well the Acura cant quite beat the Infiniti as far as straight off the line power however when it comes to the complete package for the money nothing beats the TypeS Test drove the BMW 3 series Mercedes Cclass Infiniti Lexus and Acura I went with the TypeS simply for everything you get with the car Fun to drive great power and all the extras that you would have to pay more for with another vehicle
1,I purchased a 2007 650i convertible one week ago and here are my initial comments The iDrive was easier to learn then I expected and though working the radio is certainly more complicated then having a couple of buttons still the iDrive gives you access to many sophisticated features That said my wife who owns a 2002 BMW 535 will not replace that car with another BMW if it has an iDrive which is too complex for her to operate
0,This is a beautiful car loaded with everything youll ever need and its FAST really fast Its exhaust note sounds awesome and it is comfortable beyond compare The 6speed gear box is indescribably crisp and precise For the std equipment level youd have to pay  dollar7K more on a BMW 328xi my second choice Make no mistake the sport sedan purists and cognescenti scoff at anything other than a reardrive set up That said the torque steer is WELL managed and barely perceptible The reliability of Acura   and Honda is wellknown and the technology present will keep me busy for years to come This is the baddest car for money
1,I guess I expected more from my first BMW My wife hated the way it drove around town so now its mine The transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall On the highway it rides like a dream Its like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below 100 mph I had a lifter noise and after several visits to service they had to replace the cylinder head That was another nightmare The dealer and BMW should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience
0,I work as a technical automotive writer and have written researched and driven many different types of vehicles For me the TL is the best car in its class While the G35 and IS 350 are quicker and the 330is handling dynamics are superior no other car balances performance technology comfort and value better than the TL Plus all of these cars cost quite a bit more comparably equipped
1,This is my second x3 the 1st a 2004 so I expected a better BMW but what I got was what others are complaining about poor shifting patterns at speeds under 40 mph Has been in the shop for software fixes but no improvements and the techs tell me they dont notice the problem The sport drive is horrible and this is called a sport utility vehicle This is not what I expected from BMW
0,I was recently in the market for a new automobile and I researched those that would provide me with the greatest value economy safety and technology I test drove the Lexus IS350 BMW 5 series and the MercedesBenz C350 Sport Sedan All of these automobiles were impressive in their own right but the Acura TL Type S wasnt even on my radar That is until I spoke with a few friends and they suggested that I check out the Acura TL So I did I went to the local dealership and presented them with a laundry list of items that I wanted to see on my next automobile As I ran down the list they said that all of the features that I wanted to see were STANDARD on the TL WOW
1,Driving along a back country road and slump The transmission felt like it dropped out the bottom It left me stranded since when I turned it back on it refused to recognize reverse drive any gear whatsoever Since then I have had a software update and it is still extremely sluggish in first gear and before I know it I am in third at a snail pace Highway driving is excellent but in traffic a nightmare and unreliable shifting I was told this is a worldwide problem by my dealer regarding X3 transmissions and although this is happening to several X3s it is not large enough to recall There needs to be a recall Lurching and shifting so hard that it bucks is not acceptable for a BMW
0,I recently was in the market for a new vehicle I looked at everything from the 07 Mercedes C350 Sport Sedan to the BMW 5 Series and the Lexus IS 350 I drove all of the vehicles But it only took one drive of the TL TypeS to realize the value for the price I wanted daytime running light side airbags great sound system alarm good crash ratings and navigation All of my requested items were already standard on the 07 Acura TL TypeS
1,This is our 3rd X3 and I loved the other two both 2005s This seems to be a different vehicle Same great finish and handling but awful acceleration As written elsewhere it is bothersome and dangerous I loved the responsive fun to drive qualities of our other X3s This one makes me scared to enter the highway Not so fun Once you get past 40 it is fine but getting there can be tough Sometimes you punch it and boom other times you count to three before anything happens Someone is going to get into an accident because of this We went to the dealer and they tried a software fix but it only made it marginally better and we seem to have lost 12 MPG Disappointing
0,The TSX is really a very solid car I was pleased when I purchased it and am now downright happy when I drive it It represents a perfect blend of power and efficiency If you dont hogdog it around town mid 20s is easily attainable and on the highway Ive averaged 3033mpg The features are useful and easy to operate the interior fit and finish is outstanding right down the satisfying thud of the doors closing The stereo stands out among premium stereos because of its balance  too often premium stereos overemphasize bass to the detriment of the mid and high ranges Here the bass is present but gets out of the way for vocals and instruments Not just a rebagded Accord
1,There is a lot of complaining about the automatic transmission version of this machine I bought an x3 manual with 6000 miles on it in February 2008 and have put 8000 miles on it since then This is a great vehicle if you like driving Fantastic lowend torque Great acceleration in 2nd 3rd and 4th 5th and 6 are highway overdrives Corners flat in aggressive driving Have never had better brakes Pulls a utility trailer loaded with stuff for the dump like its not there I was skeptical about BMW reliability No issues so far and the 100000 mile warranty should have me covered It doesnt have all the cup holders and storage that a Japanese vehicle has drives much better though
0,Has been a blast to own Very fun to drive solid car Only issue is the backseat is a little tight
1,I finally had enough Took a major loss by trading in the 2007 X3 Bought the car for 43K and got 29K in trade in  The transmission problem in my opinion is dangerous and makes the car unpredictable in many situations turns acceleration from stop Although I brought it back to the dealer for the fix the problem persisted In my opinion it is a disgrace that BMW has the audacity to label this thing the ultimate driving machine I have been permanently soured by the BMW brand Goodbye 
0,I love the car but I hate the gas it use 165 MPG In the city is not GOOD And that is with prem fuel Car does drive well I had a suv with a v8 to do better But i do love the way the car looks and drives But be ready to pay a lot for gas and it will drink it up
1,Transmission shifting issues  shifts so jerky it will actually make me car sick Have had back to dealer 2x for updates shifting improved but not even close to acceptable for any vehicle but this one is  dollar40k Dealer told me fix is to shift manually  no thanks I didnt buy a stick shift Live in western PA lots of hills car will not shift out of 2nd gear starting up a hill unless speed exceeds 25 mph  thats about 3500 rpm When you take your foot off the gas it throws you like hitting the brakes Terrible engineering from a premier automotive company
0,This is a very fun car Just the right amount of luxury for me I sell for a living so I have to look a certain way but it isnt ostentatious at all  I like that Just the right amount of power in my opinion but you have to be used to the notorque Honda way of engine building Fantastic in snow Weve had a week of BAD snowpacked roads and between the traction control and the ABS theres been no need for chains or 4wd
1,I bought this vehicle to be both fun and utility vehicle The transmission behaves so erratically it is downright dangerous On more than several occasions its lack of response has cause near fatal accidents It typically hesitates between 23 gear which is where you are at when entering a turnabout or merging into traffic quickly The sports drive mode down shifts so hard that you swear you have been rearended by another driver BMWNA has tried to pass this off as part of the adaptive or learning features of this car
0,Great vehicle so far Excellent MPG at 5065 mph I am averaging around 3334 mpg Runs smooth pretty quiet ride Excellent car for the money Could use more room in the backseat Acura has great service and makes a great car
1,There is definite hesitation when attempting quick acceleration The gps is horrendous Neither my husband nor myself have figured out how to enter addresses It just shouldnt be this difficult His aftermarket gps works like a dream Not only is it easy to imput data but also warns of traffic slow downs and alternative routes The stereo is mediocre The controls are mediocre
0,After owning three minivans I purchased my TSX I love it It obviously does not have the room of a minivan but I seldom needed that much room anyway I am getting 37 MPG on the highway Ive had the car for over a year now and still say I love my car when I get in it My husband wanted a six cylinder of some sort but with the price of gas skyrocketing hes pretty happy I didnt budge on my pick I wish I could afford to put the other three drivers in my family in one The two teenagers would love it and my husband would appreciate the mileage
1,I have owned the car now for about a week and it performs very well I dont find any hesitation as some reviews have stated What some call hesitation is the engine coming up on the torque curve not a transmission problem I would like to physically be able to check the oil instead of depending on the computer to tell me that it is OK This is a great automobile as every BMW I have owned was
0,After nearly a year Im still very happy with my TSX It was the best blend of features I wanted at a great price ie handling fun to drive good fuel economy safety features It moves well and emergency handling has been great Its also a good size for city driving and has all the oomph I need Im appreciating it more and more all the time
1,I bought my new X3 a week ago and it is a total nightmare I did not know that there was a major engine hesitation with many of these vehicles and mine is very bad and even dangerous The steering is not aligned due to either a wheel alignment issue or the wheel itself is not centered The controls including the navigation system are way too complex and awkward and using knobs to control everything is absurd My car has cosmetic defects on the fabric on doors and pillars and it looks like they totally left out the quality in this SUV Overall should have got the RDX
0,Nice interior feel and appointments Bluetooth is great and side cornering signals on side view mirrors a great idea Nice entry model Always wanted the TL and was happy to be able to get into an Acura at this price point Gas mileage is horrific for a 4 cylindar   and the high octane requirement is just obsured Had a heavier Honda Accord 6 cyl before this and it got 8 miles more to a gal of 87 octane gas
1,We had a 325xi wagon for the past three years and really enjoyed it We were not sure that we were going to get another BMW because we wanted to save some money on the payments So we went and drove a ton of cars and decided that we liked what BMW had to offer in either a new 325 wagon or an X3 The X3 had the best pricing incentives for a lease so we went with it The car is a base model with auto trans It handles like a BMW We like the leatherette for clean up and comfort The radio could be better for the price The DTC is miserable We turn it off all the time It makes the car hunt around in 1st and 2nd gear trying to avoid losing traction
0,The car itself is pretty good however I have had a problem with a vibration in the steering wheel since I bought the car a problem I never had wthe toyota So if you dont mind taking your hands off the wheel sometimes while at a light then its a nice car
1,Ive test driven from a toyota RAV to a Benz and all those cars dont come close to the feel styling and performance of this car Probably those other car companies will take pieces of the body style but theres only one BMW
0,Plenty fast enough for daily driving gives me an average of 33 mpg at 75 mph cruise control on long drives Its not necessarily sporty compared to actual sports cars It has stone hard economy tires and a soft luxury suspension So take it for what its worth or upgrade your tires and suspension Looks are subjective but I still think it looks nicer than most cars even after the 4 years its been in production
1,I just bought a 2007 BMW X3 I test drove a different one then took the one off the showroom floor in the color I wanted I did not notice hesitation on test drive but immediately noticed on mine It is a week old and I hate it Not to mention the stupid plastic handle that my knee constantly hits The hesitation is horrible It does it from a dead stop and while driving at slow speeds It is unacceptable to meI want to return it The transmission is so erratic that passengers complain about the rough and jolty rideit is embarrasing to tell them I spent so much on a piece of junk I think I made a mistake This is going to be my last BMW I should have bought the Nissan Murano
0,It has the right amount of luxury and sportiness I dont know what it lacks  its even fuel efficient It comes with a 205HP engine which provides enough power for anything one needs to do legally on the road
1,Okay I have myself to blame I buy a new car every two years last one was a 2004 Acura TLnot the most expensive car Ive owned but far and away the best car in every category I read the reviews for BMW X3 and know the car was not higly thought of in the pastbut that 2007 was a NEW year with many improvements The gas mileage is bad 18mpg cityhighway The tranny is rough and at low RPM there is almost zero torque and a rough go until about 25mph The electronics are less than high techthe radio is pathetic for a  dollar44k vehicleand the rear seats despite what the catalogue said do not fold flat making the rear space useless for boxes dogs and anything else
0,I decided on the TSX after looking at the BMW 3 series the Lexus IS 250 and the Infiniti G35 Sedan Compared to the other three models the TSX offered all the creature comforts I wanted for 6K less than the G35 and Lexus and 10K less than the 328i Really easy choice to make even after driving the other three cars twice each While the TSX doesnt have the speed and pickup of the BMW or the Infinity the engine is more than adequate for my style of driving mostly city with some road trips now and then My MPGs are around 20 for the city driving and 32 for highway
1,Great vehicle dynamics silky smooth transmission good trunk space switched from FX 35 which was a great car Has less interior storage compartments than FX 35 Nowhere near the interior quality of the FX My X3 has a sticker price of 44k and can you belive in that price is not even a car alarm included But what is bothering me is those very cheap controls on the radio as well as steering wheel The radio control button is awful BMW please I also miss that beautiful vehicle information screen Sound system just ok Car has a little wind noise at speeds above 55 mph City mileage 1819 mpg Highway 2425 mpg so far
0,I bought this car about two months ago I am in love with it I had a TL before but love this new car The handling is peppy yet not too much like other competitors such as a g35 The interior is easy on the eyes and all of the controls are extremely easy to use The back seat is small yet the seats fold down to make a morethanlarge trunk for this car size Handling is stiff but not quite a BMW The exterior is due for a redesign but this cars current body style is what makes it so classy Not saying a few upgrades wouldnt help
1,Time to downsize from Lincoln Aviator 07 X3 is perfect size and 13 less to fill gas tank Fun to drive agile smooth and quick Interior disappointing Have an 07 BMW 328xi and expected equivalent interior comfort features on X3 but BMW did not provide them 1 heatAC system is not dual has no vent in rear seat and no heat circulation when engine off 2 leathercomfort of sport seats inferior to 3 series 3 radio Bluetooth features are limited compared to 3 series 4 heated seats weak The iPod addon connection is awful  cant hookup while driving shows Track  not song name cord too short takes glove compartment space  use standard auxiliary Park assist feature annoying
0,Just got my 2007 Acura TSX wout nav last weekend What a great car It rides similar to my wifes 2006 Honda Accord but holds tighter through the turns and is more fun to drive There is a little less room in the back than the Accord but the front and the trunk space seems very comparable The design is becoming a little dated and the redesign should be coming out some time in late 2008 If you love Hondas but want a little more luxury then Acura is the way to go Plus you can get a steal of a deal on the TSX right now
1,My 2007 X5 has been nothing but a nightmare and the worse vehicle I have ever owned Ive owned many new BMWs 3 5 and two 7 series but my X5 is a completely different experience It is a loser a huge disappointment in terms of quality control problems but the worse part is how BMW has handled the issue  which is VERY poorly X5 was in for recurring service issues 2 months in 1st 2 years for a series of false engine warning lights Ele issues rear hatch door problems and cosmoline that drips onto glasspaint No support from BMW Had to retain attorney as BMW NA could care less BMW NA Execs clearly more concerned with their stock options than long term customers Bye bye BMW
0,Outstanding overall value You cannot beat what comes standard on the TSX for the price Leather bluetooth 360 watt stereo XM 6 CD changer heated seats with memory sunroof On top of all this the TSX is extremely fun to drive and very agile This car wants to be pushed to the limit and it eagerly responds Note this is a sport sedan not a luxury car that floats on the road like grandpas Lincoln MPG is OK average around 24 in mix driving and around 30 on the highway I guess I was expecting a slightly better MPG given the TSX comes with a 24 liter 4 cylinder engine however the TSX is engineered to maximize full use of this engine
1,Beware the 07 BMW x5 redesigned 30 model has major flaws with the transmission BMW has admitted to the issue and does not have a fix therefore recalls have not been sent out A  dollar60k car should not have a major fault The car runs sluggish especially going up hills  it has a hard time shifting into the correct gear The X5 does not accelerate well from a stopped position and it feels as if it is going to stall before it recognizes you are trying to accelerate In the past 2 months my car has been in for service 5x times for a week at a time I have been in contact with BMW North America at this point BEWARE
0,Will consume just about the same amount of gas for a 4cyl as a 6cyl TL the TSX lacks power No XM radio available even in the navi package
1,I am amazed at how good the X5 is A completely different vehicle to the old shape and to my surprise didnt think it was possible to better that one much much better too The iDrive is a little tricky at first but its childs play once you get the hang of it I test drove the Audi Q7 before and it drove like a tank with noticeable gear changes Allinall this is a great 4x4 I would recommend it but then again mine was made in Germany
0,Ive had this car for six months and I enjoy driving it every time I get in it I have the 6speed manual and it is an excellent gearbox The shifts are silky smooth and accurate The car is also an excellent value for the price Standard luxury features include handsfree Bluetooth satellite radio heated seats xenon headlamps trip computer etc and Im getting a solid average 28 mpg in mixed driving On a 500 mile trip I got over 35 mpg It may not be very sexy to look at but Id buy another one in a heartbeat
1,Great riding car Great design Terrible starting problems Have had 4 random no start situation Two in garage but two out on roads where tow truck was needed Car has been in shop 8 days with this problem and have not been able to find problem to date Scary as you dont know when it will not start Am getting rid of car now and will buy a Lexus for dependability I have been a BMW owner for last 20 years They have over the teched the car Was told it has over 50 computers in it Problem is how many work properly Do not buy
0,Quick not fast car Comfortable ride Nice interior Many features such as Bluetooth memory seats XM radio
1,I have owned the X5 for only a year and twice now I encountered a parking brake malfunction The first time this happened was on Thanksgiving day Had to get the SUV towed from the gas station manual hand brake feature would not work Just today just went to buy groceries and the parking brake malfunction went on again Had to wait for tow truck for over 2hrs No other options but to have SUV towed Very inconvenient And have to wait until Monday for dealership to open Even more inconvenient Other than this had to change 2 tires twice due to nail punctures run flats cannot be patched spent over  dollar1000 Changed one tire SUV not even a month old Not safe for long drives DO NOT BUY
0,I have to say I am very satisified with this vehicle I have had it for a month now and have about 2300 miles on it I am getting a robust 3435 MPG on highway miles and 2628 around town The car is 100 percent made in Japan which means it will last 5 star safety awesome stereo I could go on and on
1,My first BMW and my last At 55k one would expect greater reliability The cabin has been filled with squeaks and rattles even the headrest squeaks The dashboard has been taken apart twice Consistent major malfunctions abs awd hill descent cruise have shut down 5 times in less than a year wout warning Running boards are useless makes it difficult for entering exiting vehicle The 30 lags at low speeds always needing to shift into sport mode The ride over uneven road surfaces is punishing Steering is very stiff always need 2 hands at low speeds No available option for a remote start due to the complex wiring The quality material of the sunvisors is poor not even a place for sunglass
0,I just bought a brand new 2007 TSX automatic tranny wno navigation so I could save the  dollar1000 It is much peppier than my previous car a 2002 Mazda Millenia The interior is well thought out and the engine purrs along nicely I really dont get much chance to drive it the way I would like since I am normally stuck in traffic but I can tell it wants to go On the highway it is a dream sportier than my previous car and very smooth
1,My loaded X5 has 14000 miles  Week 1 faulty oil line spent 1 week at the dealer 1 month later computer crash 4 more days at the dealer This month transmission failure 1 more week at dealer Now I am told that I need new tires for 250000 Yes the x5 is fun to drive and great looking but is not worth the price tag Just bought my wife loaded 2007 MDX for 2000000 less than the X5 It might not be the high performance machine but it has not been back to the dealer and it really has better options Stay away from the X5
0,I love this car so much its my third post Im 15000 perfect miles in Not a hint of any kind of problem All the tech stuff is perfect the engine the tranny the leather the fit and finish the paint its all perfect If you forced me to complain about something I would have to say its a touch noisy on some surfaces and the stereo is mediocre But thats being very picky its a fantastic car loaded with luxury power handling looks exclusivity and very reasonable on gas considering the power I couldnt love it or respect it more Right on Acura
1,This is my 4th BMW X5 and the first one I am not in love with The interior is noisy The transmission does not seem as responsive as previous models The sport seats are not comfortable The iDrive is very buggy Has been in the shop several times already My previous X5s never saw the shop once except for an oil change Will try to sell this one Kind of disappointed since for the last 10 years every car I have owned has been a BMW
0,I have had this car for a week but have been lusting ever since it debuted in 2004 My wife bought it for me as a birthday present and I have been ecstatically behind the wheel every day The car handles the twisties with minimal body roll and the engine is eager to rev The steering is precise and Honda does the best shifters in the business The interior has the quality of cars costing 10K more
1,This new BMW X5 is a shocker The SUVSAV is so cheaply made on the interior that it buzzes and rattles over all roads My 12year old insisted that the back seats felt like sitting in the plastic bleachers at a school ball game I like BMW and Im shocked that this car ever left the test facility Its all engine and suspension and performs well but the build quality is cheap The leather seating surfaces are hard and felt like vinyl
0,I had a 2001 Altima which wasnt a bad car Even though the TSX is a bit smaller inside it has more room plus its much nicer too I was contemplating getting a V6 Nissan or Honda but gas prices started to rise I settled on the TSX I have a short commute and otherwise drive almost exclusively around Jacksonville FL My mileage is a consistent 22 mpg meaning mixed highwaysuburban driving I might get better if I laid off of the gas pedal but its fun to push it Being an auto you have to get it in the right gear but it has the power to pull ahead when I need to I havent had many chances to try the handling but when I have its really held the road Its a great car
1,This is my 3rd X5 and was I thought a no brainer to purchase Wrong Part of my disappointment may come from the fact that my previous X5s were 40s This car feels underpowered and slow in many situations The seats are very different from my old X5 I have yet to find a comfortable setting have driven 10000 miles so far The X5 has changed its size slightly but enough that it is difficult for a short person to enter My runflat got a flat at 5000 and they would not fix it only replace it for  dollar400 Car has had some computer glitches got towed away DEAD at 3000 dealership never could figure it out The info screen goes dead sometimes for no reason Not a great BMW
0,I wanted a sporty vehicle that was much quieter than my 2005 Celica but just as fun to drive the TSX delivers that along with the leather package 6speed ultrasmooth gearbox sunroof bluetooth premium sound package and good mileage to boot Only downsides  premium fuel just like any performance engine and the 24L inline 4 loses a bit of its punch with the AC running but compensates at higher RPM My 07 TSX is not quite broken in yet at 8650 miles  I view the 10K mark as the adequate setin to allow me to really punch it right after oil change 2 Im looking forward to that day
1,This car has issues Please be aware that idrive software is buggy and still a work in process Many of the features do not work Stupid stuff like tilt steering brightness on display push buttons for radio stations Biggest issue with this vehicle is the problems many are having with the transmission High revving and thump upon slow down Car will spend much time in the shop
0,As a longtime Toyota owner 20 years I was ready for another Camry or an upgrade to the Avalon However after reading mediocre reviews on the new Camry and with the Avalon looking dated and overpriced I looked at the Acura The car is loaded with so many more standard features that are options with Toyota Only had the car for two weeks but a terrific ride and great value a luxury car with a modest price Worth a serious look and test drive
1,I was so excited to get one of the first 48is in production November 2006 to the point that I never considered that the car would be anything but better than my old 2003 44 As of late April 2007 Id take back my old 44 in a second The new X5 is a pig Much slower less comfortable the sport edition seats are incredibly uncomfortablethings like my cell phone cant charge when the car is offand that unbelievibly annoying seat belt alarm you cant put groceries on the passenger front seat as an example makes really angry at BMW And yes I will sell it shortly
0,I have had the car for just over two weeks and am completely satisfied with my choice I test drove four competitor vehicles and found the TSX to be the most fun to drive and best value of the bunch I commute about 100 miles a day mostly highway miles and find the gas mileage acceptable 30 mpg Seems 66 mph is the sweet spot for best mpg on the highway I appreciated most of the extras being standard which makes finding the right vehicle simply a question of which transmission which color and with or without navigation I highly recommend the navigation
1,Worst Car Ive Ever Owned Although the car is a head turner I am anxiously counting the days until my lease is over and I can turn this horrible car back to the dealership German suspensions are wonderful for flawless German roads but unfortunately the suspension is way way too stiff for flawed American roads The ride is HORRIBLE I feel every bump in the road The seats are poorly padded and after a half hour in the car I am ready to get out of it ASAP Sadly I took it from Washington DC to New York and by the time I got to my destination I wanted to leave it on the side of the road That was the last road trip for it now only use it because it is small and easy to park
0,Spent 3 months shopping around for a new car Looked at a long list of cars TSX TL G35 IS 250 Camry Altima Mazda3 5door In the beginning I was looking at the TSX and came full circle with it The car is great definitely a good and reasonable investment I was willing to give up the performance for fuel economy Even with the inline 4 the car moves its not like a TLS or G35 but its enough for everyday driving The car looks a lot better in person than in pictures I love the car more and more everyday
1,When the Z4 came out to replace the Z3 I thought they ruined the idea Its a much different car and when you drive it you can forget about the Z3 The lines on the car all seem to fit and have purpose even though Im not a fan of the Bangle designs I bought the Z4 30si convertible which is a fast car and looks unbelievable with the sport package and 18 wheels The sport package completely changes the look and driving of the car its a must Its fast enough even with the auto trans which has the paddle shifters The extended leather and premium M seats are a must too All the options raise the price but if youre seriously considering this car cost is not a concern
0,TSX has everything you wantneed included XM Bluetooth leather trip computer peppy engine smooth trans exceptionally comfortable driver seat great handling fun to drive
1,This review focuses more on the bad fragile paint scratches too easily mostly plastic cant wax out those scratches annoying beeper wont shut up for 1 minute no chimes seat belt cant be adjusted irritates neck runflat tires sensitive added air twice in 4 months 6 speed manual doesnt shift smoothly doesnt hold value depreciated 13K  4 months so Im stuck steering keeps driver way too active ride quality on rough roads is unacceptable feel every imperfection noisy with roof up rattles BMW engineers have ruined this car Our 2003 Z4 was superior Yep I have high standards especially when I pay 47K for a new BMW
0,All the features I wanted stepping into an entry Luxury Sedan and more that I never thought about I thought based on the price of the car why not go for the additional nav system and complete the package
1,A good 2nd car for fun in the sun with great looks and handling but not a suitable replacement for my 2000 540i The wind noise on the highway and comfort on bumpy roads is not very good so consider this for daily travel More of a weekend lets have fun car Personally I think our 2003 Z4s 5speed shifted smoother and quicker and its ride was not so harsh as I recall so Im a bit disappointed by this 2007 Z4 The 6speed shifting bothers me the most since I do a lot of it Oh well
0,Everything is standard on this car except nav leather sunroof VSA trip computer 10 way driver seat 4 year 50000 mile warranty Lacks a little in power especially torque but is strong once you get above 2750 rpm Driver seat comfort and adjustments are excellent Rear seat a little cramped for two full sized adults Build quality is better than TL as are front seats
1,I leased a 2007 BMW Z4 30si to use as a daily driver as my wife drives our 2006 Land Cruiser It did not take long to realize that this car is for weekends only It is cramped and the ride over older roads will knock fillings out of your mouth That said it is a great sports car The handling transmission and power are great It is an absolutlely fun car in the cool of the morning or for a romantic drive in the evening but it is not intended to replace a sedan I am taking the penalty to get the 2008 535i
0,I really do love the car and do not regret the purchase whatsoever The car is great fun to drive accelerates smoothly but youll pay for the fun at the gas pump
1,This car is a definite good buy I have leased this 2006 BMW Z4 30i and so far I have been satisfied The overall perfomance is great but one thing I would rather have is front wheel drive instead of rear because it affects driving in rain Since I live in Las Vegas the rain is not an often issue but when it actually rains I have to watch out and drive carefully on turns Gas mileage is rather typical for 30 Interior design is not what I have expected and this is my biggest disappointment It really looks cheap maybe because I am used to Audis unusual design but still this is not so good for a BMW
0,I just went from a 2004 Honda Accord EXL to a Acura TSX with navigation system and I must say that I am happy with my decision so far I love the Acura navigation system really easy to use I did love the Honda Accord though The car is absolutely fun to drive I cannot wait for a new refreshed version of the TSX hopefully with more room and better gas mileage also with more power Excellent car choice nonetheless
1,I was driving a Maxima for some time and wanted a change I was convinced to buy American when I really didnt want too If I knew then what I know now I would never have gotten this Buick LaCrosse This Buick has been to the dealership 5 times for ONE problem something with the steering column I was given an extended warranty by Buick but that did not work Its still not working right The car is going back for round six and the SAME ISSUE I am never going with American cars again Thanks Buick for making such great American products HA
0,I traded my 06 TL for the more attractive looking TSX and am happy I did The TSX has everything I liked about the TL and more importantly it doesnt have the things I didnt like about the TL It is quicker off the mark handles better better mileage not by much though and it was made in Japan I really hated the mapholders on the TL but they are gone sort of in the TSX Also the rear end of the TSX is much more attractiveThe TL was of course quieter but I am always playing something in the audio system which actually sounds better in the TSX than the TL All in all I am happier with the TSX than the TL Be sure to test drive both
1,The car is like a standard transmission on hills You have to be quick from brake to gas because it will roll back I am having trouble getting tires balanced Dealer replaced all four tires on car because they could not be balanced I am still having trouble on rear tires They have been balanced three times I am taking the car back to try again I have 2500 miles on car at this time The radio skips stations I was told by dealers that the transmission was normal to me it is a danger as cars pull up close behind I have been back to dealer so much I am taking a rest for a while
0,This car would be perfect if had at least a little more low end power 1st and 2nd gear and also had a more precise feeling shifterclutch  more like the 97 Integra
1,I traded my 2001 Century for the 2007 LaCrosse Bad mistake Interior is small Everything inside is plastic and rattles all the time It has rattled since I drove it off the lot with 5 miles on it Chrome and fake wood reflect sunshine bad and streetlights relfect bad off of it at night Those pieces also rattle Took it to the dealer and they said nothing could be done about the rattling Windshield leaks air and has a whistle at 60 mph Gas mileage stinks Century got 10 mpg better even after 150000 plus miles Trunk is very hard to shut Large trunk but small opening Rough ride with a lot of road noise Im very disappointed in this car
0,My girlfriend and I have never been so pleased with a car We traded in our Audi A4 for the TSX and fell in love with the comfort and technology We use bluetooth all the time and the nav system blows everything else out of the water Acuras navigation system is honestly the absolute best on the market I cant wait to see what they come out with next
1,Overall very satisfied but have a few warnings MPG is hopelessly below what the EPA sticker says barely get 20mpg in city Although the trunk is voluminous the opening is smaller than the Century and I find it difficult to get large objects inside And whoever put that piece of chrome across the middle of the dash so all sunlight from 10am to 2pm shines directly in the drivers eyes needs to be flogged
0,This car has a lot of items equipped as standard especially Bluetooth Handsfree XM radio   and Xenon headlights Even though TSX is FWD you can enjoy the adequate power from 24L I4 engine above 3k rpm Fit and finish is exceptional
1,Driving compartment feels cramped parking seems to require more effort on the steering wheel Closing the trunk lid requires you to put your hands on the trunk to close the lid Needs a handle
0,Awesome ratings Take it for a test drive and yup its sold This unique car supports that Acura has high standards This car is superb to none other The VSA stability is awesome The Navi system is a must for the price Dont just look DRIVE it I enjoy that my husband talked me into this vehicle I dont want to get out of it when I pull up to my house I have never been so happy with a material item but I am smiling even when I am sleeping  When the voice command talks she seems to be smarter than I am So now I have some competition I think I might have to name her AlsoIf I get mad at her I can change her to a man voice and name him Enrique or Juan
1,Mixed highwaysuburban mileage driven in flat to somewhat hilly areas Average mileage per gallon between fillups rarely reaches 20mpg Given Japanese competition thats rather surprising Our 2001 LeSabre does it better Was forewarned by Consumer Reports but bought the car nevertheless because I liked looks and rideTime Elapsed feature doesnt work outside temperature gage is off by at least five degrees too high clock has lost two minutes in three months of ownership For my next purchase Ill try and overcome my Buy American hangup if necessary
0,This vehicle is so much fun to drive It is solidly built has plenty of pep handles like a dream I understand the exterior will be changed in 2008 but I find the 2007 to have a classic clean design The interior hugs you the drivers seat is very comfortable no backaches here Its an Acura so everything is ergonomically and stylishly designed I just attended the 2007 Auto Show and couldnt find a vehicle I liked better even in the higher price ranges I recommmend this car wholeheartedly
1,My only problem with the 2007 is the non retracting side mirrors i live in a metro city on small street and still dont understand why car manufacturers dont make this a SOP Obiviously they dont have to pay to have their side mirrors replaced annualy Not to mention the smokers package i wont start on that you non smokers should keep your hands out of my pocket
0,Did a lot of research and test drove many different models When I drove this car I knew I had finally found what I had been looking for Everything is standard No need to purchase options Fun to drive Handles great
1,Sometimes it feels like the only way I could get the gas mileage to be better is if I pushed it with the engine off I cannot get this over 21mpg I am not an aggressive driver I set the cruise between 65 and 70 yet still the avg MPG never goes above 21 on the highway Sometimes I feel that I should have bought the V8 at least I would have had some power with my cruddy gas mileage or I may have even gotten better mileage with the V8 Why did GM kill the 38 2000 LeSabre had 15 more hp better torque and 33mpg on the highway Whatwhy did they change it
0,The last Acura I owned was a 91 Legend coupe it was a great car This car is as much fun drive as my old Legend The car corners like a dream and feels like a 6 cyl The car accelerates as smooth as silk I drive a Prius to work because I can get into the HOV I cant wait for the weekends to drive the TSX Bang for the buck you cant beat this car My gas mileage with about 300 miles on the car is a combined 26 mpg
1,Car was a dealer demo I was sold based on a test drive It was and remains very quiet and luxurious feeling in that aspect However the drivers seat left side molding cracked and broke of its own accord with a quartersized piece popping off and landing in the drivers foot well Now two weeks later it seems like the entire drivers door interior panel is trying to separate from the metal with a give of at least an inch when closing the door Two months ago the OnStar stopped working on its own and took 3 tries to fix Handling feels weird at 45 mph like Cruise is taking over on its own Very disappointing all around and I wish I could have my Chrysler 300 back
0,For the price this car is too much fun to drive Its got great handling ample power when needed good fuel economy looks sharp but not gaudy and is very comfortable These were my main criteria and this car is the best balance of these at this price range I also looked at the Mazda6 which I considered the closest comparison based on my criteria In the end an easy choice I suspect the main knock is that you are paying a few  dollarK more for a glorified Accord There is some legitimacy in that argument but once you get inside that will melt away I love this car Do yourself a favor  the 6 speed manual box is really sweet and is an absolute must
1,This is not my 95 Roadmaster but I didnt expect it to be Mileage is a little disappointing with the 6 cylinder 1719 city 285  306 Highway excellent fit and finish like the driver info center plenty of leg room head room when entering could be better
0,Has all the features you want memory seats leather blue tooth sat radio peppy motor and trans comfortable seats sunroof all standard
1,I own a 2003 Buick Park Avenue and I bought the 2007 Lucerne CXL in February 2008 as a retirement vehicle It only took one 400 mile trip to make me appreciate my Park Avenue and be glad that I did not sell or trade it I love the way the Lucerne handles on a rainy road however the seats are not comfortable the gas mileage is poor the entry and exiting process is a torture for me at 6 2 and left turns and parking are a chore My long road trips will continue to be made in the Park Avenue My wife can drive the Lucerne around town I will only buy another Buick if they improve on the issues mentioned
0,Excellent car It comes fully loaded for a not so loaded price Fit and finish can not be beat
1,As a long time Park Ave owner I was spoiled This Lucerne is no Park Ave Window sticker showed 28 mpg highway and I have not gotten close to that 263 is best I have gotten and mostly 24 to 25 mpg On the 04 Park Ave on the same trips I would get 31 to 32 mpg Same engine they say but Buick says they changed the gear ratio and I ask why and get no answer I find it difficult to get in and out of and the head room is poor My next car will not be a Buick Lucerne unless they improve on the fuel economy
0,This car is fantastic Fun to drive very comfortable and gets up to speed fast I drive 25 miles on the interstate every day and this car makes the drive enjoyable Headlights are great gas mileage is wonderful and I am a very satisfied driver
1,This is not my fathers buick We switched from a Mercury product due to styling leg room rear seat roomI am 66 tall and this gives me the room We can manage about 29MPG on the open road and about 21MPG every day driving all with regular gas It has been mistaken for a Lexus ES350 on several occassions
0,Sold my 2k Celica and got an 07 TSX Perfect transition Its a bit larger with 4 doors and has much more power I actually use every feature its got and its awesome I never need to take my phone out of my pocket or reach over for any controls Everything can be controlled by either voice steering wheel or headunit At first I thought the gearing was weird but in the city its perfect because you can do most of your driving in 3rd or 4th to reduce shifting You dont need the iPod connector because it has an AUX jack standard Seats heat up extremely fast
1,Prior to the purchase of the new 2007 Buick Allure CXL Lucerne in the US I noted a vibration in the steering and seat at 60  70 mph I was informed by the dealer this would be taken care of After a wheel balance and replacement of tires the vibration did not disappear I am not satisfied after paying over  dollar3800000 and expect GM to correct the problem This is my 5th or 6th Buick purchase and I have never encountered this before The console cup holder design inside storage storage at the back of the front seat storage has been greatly limited from previous models The right hand windshield wiper does not clear road smudge very well The ride is much quieter and smoother
0,After a lot of research we bought a 2007 TSX Auto wNAVI Glacier Blue for its standard options price reliability Wonderful car zippy ride comfy seats nice leather Voice activated nav is awesome Paired my Bluetooth phone in one min My wife loves to drive it My son connected his iPod in 2 sec After driving this car really my wifes car I am jealous My 2004 S430 has no Bluetooth or iPod connectivity my nav is not voice activated
1,I have found that My Lucerne CSX is one of my better purchases from my previous GM cars I have been compimented about my Lucerne I have had people that have commented on the ride the quiteness the sport car type handling I just say with the price of gas today It is the only drawback in as far of not getting good gas mileage But one has to expect that when you have 275 horses to pull you around All in all I would recommend the Buick Lucerne to all those that would be considering a Japanese equivelent Quailty performance price and better warranty than those from the Pacific rim No contest
0,This car is much more fun to drive than TL and IS Very nimble It takes corners like a sports car I am very itchy to 060 mph but the delivery guy told me I have to take it easy for first 600 miles Driver seat is very comfortable Very bright Xenon lights First 3 months XM radio service for free Very simple dash board design layout I am very happy with my purchase Thanks Acura
1,With a few exceptions the Lucerne is a fantastic automobile It drives and rides like a dream and is the quietest vehicle I have ever ridden in The drawbacks visability is poor  cant see where the front or rear is in the case of parking  windows too high obstructing visibility in tight parking areas cant see parking slot markings Dont campare vehicle with its competition in close proximity because the rough sounding 3800 V6 just doesnt sound like something coming from a real classy car Gas mileage is also 6 to 7 MPG less than my 03 Lesaber with same enginetrans etc Softer leather on the seats would also help Even with these problems its a fine road car
0,I bought TSX a month ago to replace 02 Accord From the number the engine size increased from 23L to 24L power and fun are a huge step up The TSX displays a marvelous balance between smooth power delivery sure footed handling responsive steering and luxury comfort The TSX is great fun to drive After I managed the SportShift mode its even more fun than before Besides fun it comes loaded with just about every feature standard I like Xenon lights bluetooth handsfree link memory power leather seats XM radio sound system and all interior design Highly recommend this vehicle
1,When making a left turn the side view mirror and the wide A pillar block your view of the road Car was delivered with a faulty Body Control Module computer resulting in intermittent error messages My 2001 Park gave a smoother ride Fit and finish were very good Complex electronic driver controls are difficult to masteresspecially for seniors
0,This car is absolutely amazing in every respect The honda vtech engine isnt the quickest engine out there but over all performance MPG and reliability are unbeatable I still cant believe this is only a 4banger The 07 comes packed with new stuff from previous models including bluetooth phone MP3 jack and a nice information system Handling is best in class Great job HondaAcura Drove MB C230 BMW Infiniti and Lexus IS 350 by far the best value and best style
1,I cannot get rid of the vibration and the seats are uncomfortable The cooled seats only cool a small portion The rear of the car looks like a dollar10000 car not a  dollar35000 car
0,Best value for the price Loaded with standard features that are optional on other cars in the same class This car has an understated elegance I would highly recommend the TSX to anyone in the market for a new vehicle who wants subtle sportiness with luxury
1,The seats are too small and the seats do not cool as they should The entry and exit system is a laugh The only real problem I have had is vibration I took it back to the dealer but it did not help It is not a good buy at  dollar33000
0,The Acura TSX was for lack of a better word perfect in all respects The price was very reasonable and the amount of standard features were amazing to say the least I could not have bought a better car for a better price simply put The handling is a dream come true and in Bakersfield heated seats in the winter are a must The duel climate control tailors itself to any temperature I desire The powerful yet efficient 205 horse power engine provides the perfect balance of torque and fuel mileage I would suggest the 07 Acura TSX to any one looking for a luxury car that outperforms bmw and mercedes with the price tag not much more than a honda accord
1,I have had the car only 600 miles and today as I opened the front driver side door the door handle pulled out of the door frame It took me a good while to try to get it back in so that I could get into the car I finally did but have no idea whether the same thing will happen again I have just had it into the dealer to repair a dent in the make ready opearation and hate to think about having it tied up for another long trip to the dealer Are others having trouble indicating such sloppy workmanship Such a mishap makes me wonder whether I can trust the car or not The socalled cool seats do not cool much of the seat
0,Owning an Audi has its highs and lows just as any other make out on the road I have had some fun with my 2007 A4 it is very comfortable for all types of driving Unfortunately the FSI motors that Audi drops in these cars are garbage Power is fine handeling is impeccable solid running motor but HUGE OIL ISSUES In most of the A4s FSI motor the rings around the pistons are bad causing oil to burn rapidly right out of your exhaust Just look at your tailpipes and you will see what Im talking about If you look at all the other Audi vehicles only the A4 has this problem If you are changing your oil every 15002000 miles contact Audi USA for your Engine Replacement
1,I finally relented and traded in our 1998 Aurora with 105000 miles It had virtually no problems I did not want a Cadillac yet and will never buy an import vehicle With Oldsmobile gone I turned to Buick and leased a black 2007 Lucerne CXS with the Cadillac Northstar 46 litre V8 The Buick now has three Wildcat badges from the 1968 version and has the style to go with the name GM should have brought back a name like Wildcat rather than Lucerne In California a Lucerne is a half gallon of milk from Safeway not a county in Switzerland
0,I just got the car about 5 months ago Its been great and everything it drives great The engine is kind of noisy The muffler tips get black quickly no clue why Mine is automatic Its fun to drive comfortable and everything When coming to a stop and its about to downshift from 3rd to 2nd the car shakes Also turbo lag at start Wish it had just a little bit more power But its enough
1,This is not a Park Avenue Was told by salesman this was the replacement The car is not very comfortable at all after about 45mins your lower backrear end really start to ache Lent the car to my secretary she made the same comment Have also had the front air deflector fall off 3 times at highway speeds which Buick will not replace as a warranty item Finally tore it off and just drive without it Heated seats work well but the AC seat function cools about a 3x8 inch strip of the seat near your crotch nothing more If you want a car for long drives look elsewhere
0,Just bought a 2007 A4 Quattro 20 used with 18K miles in excellent condition The car performs like no other car I have had First handling   and ride are excellent Fuel economy has been 22 MPG on short trips and around 30 on longer trips The seats both leather and power are very comfy and the interior is very well assembled Only complaint is the short leg room in the rear seats but since the kids are no longer at home it will only be used occasionally HINT If you raise the front seat slightly you can move the seat forward enough to allow more space for rear leg room There are 2 trip computerswhich were hard to use but after reading the manual it makes sense See below
1,For a big car it is small inside The seats are not comfortable Very little elbow room between seats In the first year the car has been back at the dealership for four weeks I have had a lot of electrical problems erratic fan blower twice and remote entry failure The owners manual says that the climate control is suppose to automaticly cool and heat with remote start it does not The dealership tells me it is not suppose to I guess the owners manual must be wrong not I have had it back twice for a knock in the steering column Turning radius is no very tight Have to make wide turns when entering head in parking spot
0,I have been wanting the car for a while and had the hardtop A4 at the end of the lease nothing sounded better and I was right Right after driving out of the dealership with 9 miles on the odometer I got plenty of looks on the street The car just like any Audi drives beautifully their windblocker assures your perfect hair day isnt ruined I love how fast the top closes and how little of my own work it takes to openclose it just a touch of my finger This car also does look great with the top up which is not a common thing for convertibles in todays market
1,I traded in a Toyota Avalon for the Lucerne From the rear they look similar Beaautiful car Very comforrtable heated seats a must for my wife Milage very good Engine a little noisy but not bad Over all quitness is great
0,I recently bought an 07 A4 Quattro after comparing several other brands The build quality gas mileage and AWD were a no brainer The car is quiet fuel efficient and fast The turbo four is a great engine
1,Difficult entry and exit Doors swing closed when trying to exit Owner options on computer difficult to do I liked the LaSabre 2005 much better
0,It was a toss up between the A4 and BMW 3 series I went with A4 as the interior is superior in my opinion So far no regrets Good power handling and fuel economy All said I would buy another Audi without hesitation
1,This could really be a hit for GM but the engine problems that have affected it are not going to help I have been having a pinging noise with the V8 GM acknowledged there is a problem with this engine Yet they continue to sell it It did not make the noise when purchased it started at about 1000 miles GM indicated this usually happens around 20K miles Interesting to find out when they wanted my money they did not bother to tell me about potential problems Now that they have my money they will only give me that they are working on the problem Im not satisfied with their answer Knowing they had a problem the option should have been pulled Poor development by GM
0,Driving my A4 is both comfortable and fun It is especially nice on the freeway when you can slip it into 6th gear and just cruise Its acceleration from a stop is a little slow but once you get going it accelerates quite nicely
1,Originally considering a smaller sedan I went out and compared estimated mileage and prices Honda Nissan Toyota and Volkswagen came up short on the quality and attractiveness end and did not offer substantial mileage savings when models were compared headtohead on power and price My CXL has highend stereo great looking leather sunroof remote start and is one of the best looking sedans on the road Ranks with BMW and Cadillac on looks for the price of an ugly Japanese car
0,I own an Audi A4 20T and it is very fun to drive and great looking style I dont regret
1,When driving during the day without lights the three dials on the instrument panel are dark I just came back from the dealer and he tells me thats the way it is My wifes Toyota Camry instrument panel lights up during the day The bottom half of the center dial lights but the top half with the speedometer numbers is dark The guage on the right with fuel level etc is completely dark So is the RPM guage but I dont need that I cant believe that the 2007 Lucerne has been designed this way Had I noticed this during the driving test I wouldnt have bought it
0,Performance is better than expected quality and finish are outstanding MultimediaNAV is the best only I would add touchcontrols I tried BMW 325xi A4 is smaller firmer more fun to drive and feels faster Recommend A4 over the A3 especially when you buy it with quattro or A6 boring since I had both for a while before
1,I have found a few very minor things that are annoying but nothing that would keep me from buying another Lucerne I have not had the car back to the dealer for any problems since I purchased the car in March
0,I purchased the new 2007 A4 on 936 The manual transmission really allows you to drive this car and as a V4 it gets over 30 miles to the gallon Driving it a long way home in the pouring rain wasnt an issue as the 4WD and the quattro system really helps with handling Very comfortable interior top end stereo and tight gear shift make this a fun family car Take the kids to practice or give it a spin on the country roads with the wife on a Sunday afternoon both can be fun in this solid family sedan  the 2007 A4
1,Have had three previous Buicks This one is really good but not a good as the old Park Ave or LeSabre Not enough head room and the seats are not as wide The rear vision is not as good Back seat and trunk are very roomy
0,This is an unbelievable car that has as much pep in its step as a BMW but with more elegance and minus a couple thousand dollars
1,Shortly after taking possesion of our Lucerne we noticed that the headliner in the front right section was sagging Dealer inspected the problem and said the headliner had to be replaced since the warp in the headliner could not be repaired It was also noticed that the headliner felt had rawor frayed and exposed edges both in the front and rear Certainly not a very finished look To replace the headliner the dealership had to remove and replace the front windshield to enable them to get the new headliner into to car
0,I have been driving BMWs for the last 16 years but just purchased a preowned 2007 A4 the tight ride the excellent gas mileage and the bang4thebuck were the overriding factors influencing my decision This is my first frontwheel drive car which has taken a bit to get used to other than that I am still satisfied with my decision
1,I replaced an E class Mercedes with a Buick Lucerne due to the poor reliability of the Mercedes The Buick drives as well as the Mercedes with on road mileage almost as good Only two features of the Buick bother me the rather large turning circle and the total lack of style of the rear of the car Other than that I am very satisfied with the car
0,This is the complete package Fun to drive beautiful interior great in any weather zippy What more do you want in a car this size
1,Great looking car I get a lot of complaimts on it Its loaded to the max I am 63 and the room inside is great Got the old school split seat 40 20 40 Ii can sit behind me with the seat all the way back Gas mileage is not what they say getting 10 miles to the gal not 17 to 19 but I live in Brooklyn so we stop every 20 feet I was a Lincoln owner for 30 years They lost my bussiness and did not care that they lost me Being old school the car needs whitewall tires Put vogues on it Really a sharp looking car
0,This A4 is my second Audi first was a 1997 A4 Audi has definitely stepped up their game I drive a lot and am currently at 53000 miles and have not had 1 problem Consistent 31 MPG even with driving at 80 MPH Highly recommended
1,Handles great on trips all the bells   and whistles you would want Biggest complaint is with rear seats down it is difficult to access a cooler behind the driver from the passenger side Sun visors are to small and for the price you would think it would have pull outs so when you use them as a side visor they would block the top of the driverspassengers window Very aggravating
0,I have been real disappointed with the A4 32 CVT I had 30 Quattro before and there is no companison Quattros are what Audi is all about The CVT transmission is jerky in the 32 It is a boring ride I once tried to accelerate and had a delayed response It is fast and comfortable but I plan to get rid of it and go back to a Quattro
1,With over 17000 miles on my Rainier there have been zero problems with the vehicle I purchased the Rainier because the seats in my 2004 LeSabre were so uncomfortable my wife could not ride in it for any distance even though we had zero problems with it over 85000 miles and still experienced 32 mpg on the highway and 22 in my commute to work The Rainiers ride is great wind noise in minimal seating comfort is perfect Im 64 and my wife is 56 and the towing and carrying flexibility are outstanding While the mpg averages are less than the LeSabre I still average slightly over 22 mpg on the highway and a little over 15 mpg commuting to work This was Buicks best kept secret
0,Had my Audi for a year now and very pleased Car is governed for 135 Rides well and can get 36 mpg at 60 mph Around town if you go 47 mph it is easy to get 32 mpg
1,When it was time to replace my DeVille we decided to purchase another Ranier Now my wife and I both drive Raniers and are extremely satisfied with them We have had no problems with the 2004 only going back to the dealer for oil changes Hopefully we will get that same level of satisfaction from the new one Gas mileage is not great but as advertised We get 21 to 23 on the highway which is not bad for a heavy vehicle Buick did cheapen the interior since 2004 with different sun visor brackets and mirrors and no overhead assist handle over the driver They did however add the wood trimmed steering wheel and gear shifter
0,Bought an 07 BMW 328i and got out of it 2 months later I cant believe how cheap BMW has become and those run flat tires are pure junk I never drove an Audi until a friend recommended and kept telling me to drive the A4 This thing is solid tight and drives amazing The Bose system is nice but all the speaker and Bose amp are going and being replaced with much higher end speakers and keeping the head unit Audi is definitely the ultimate driving machine BMW I defect
1,The 2004 Rainier that I had rode a lot quietier This 2007 has a wind noise starting at 35 mph and gets louder I have had it back to 2 different dealers for this problem as suggested by GM motors They can doing nothing at this time because of no recalls or service bulletins It seems to me that it is the door seals on the back Sounds like the back window is open a little on both sides
0,The A4 Avant is agile on the road and its a blast to drive For the price you really get a lot for your money Most significantly I feel firmly tied to the road during poor driving conditions The sleek look of the Avant puts to rest the popular notion that wagons are boring and unsexy
1,GM used to mean quality in my family but this car has been a complete disappointment Since buying it in 2007 with 13k miles Ive had to spend  dollar6k more in repairs due to persistent inability of car to start including faulty wiring axle and wheel train replacement of loose or prematurely broken parts and a brake job In the 11 years that I owned a subaru I never had to do any more than change the oil For this car I had to even subscribe to onstar for peace of mind because the car is so unreliable Based on the quality of this car I can see how GM got themselves into thier current setuation Let a free market economy rule I am headed back to the Subaru dealership for a new car
0,We have the sline package with the firmer suspension 18 inch wheels and upgraded leather I absolutely love this car We had a 2003 30 litre A4 before and we stuck with Audi instead of buying a 335 BMW because they are such a great company to deal with and their engineering is beautiful inside and out I wasnt sure if I wanted the 6 speed manual until I drove it and loved it It is awesome fun up in the mountains and the gas mileage is way better than our previous automatic Also no one beats the Audi interior for the money It is better than my buddys brand new  dollar90000 BMW 650i interior It is an incredible car for the money
1,Ive had this Buick for six months and just got done driving 1000 miles down the east coast with close to 30 miles per gal of gas Im 64 and I still have plenty of head room even with a hat onThe radio and cd are find as far as Im concerned
0,Bought the A4 6500 miles ago Seats are amazing you never need to stop on long trips only adjust lumbar on long trips Fuel ecnomy is excellent but it requires premium as expected with a turbo AWD combined with winter tires makes this car the best Ive driven in extreme winter conditions Consumer reports rates this a recommeded buy one of the main reason I purchased it Traditionally pre05 audis were not nearly a reliable My previous car was an acura RSX a more reliable I am told car but not nearly as nice of handling or design I only hope this car will be as problem free as my Acura was but I am not counting on it This is the price paid for nicer handling and design
1,We have been very unhappy with this vehicle The fuel economy has been terrible average 16 mpg with a mix of highway and city driving My husband is 64 and when he is driving my children have no room for their legs in the back seat A car seat is out of the question behind him We have the split reclining middle row not sure if this is why But my kids absolutely hate this car Numerous problems serviced the next day after purchase and should go in again but am to busy and because this is a lease Im leaving with the noisy turns poor gas mileage poor leg room for children and the interior roof coming apart in the back Rear seat belts end up under the folding seat hard to get
0,After testdriving the 32L I could not settle for the 20T While the 20T is peppy the 32 is bruteforce power but with a terrific handling finesse The exterior lines are sleek and not overdesigned like some competitors coughBMW The interior is likewise sleek without the BMW austerity or Lexus froufrou The engine just purrs and no matter what your speed the 32 has plenty of power in reserve The GPS is top notch the Bose system is pure concert hall sound and the overall design is classic Amazing how a 10yearold Audi doesnt look nearly as dated as a younger Lexus Merc or BMW Most importantly I took a broadside hit from a Dodge Ram and was fine Audi  1 Dodge  0
1,Turning radius fantastic Removable center seats great Rear door opening OK Rear door closing you got to be kidding It is very heavy with no power or air shock assist Only bad feature to the vehicle
0,Ive been eyeing and dreaming of driving this car for 7 years you hear me 7 years Solid performance nice handling luxurious interior a product of real German engineering Really does well on turning on sharp curves it hugs the road You name it rain snow ice its there 4 seasons in a year Yeah it gets bored in the summer
1,Afer having a baby my husband and I knew that the Pontiac G6 that we owned was too small for a now family of 3 We looked and looked to find a SUV in our price range and found that all of the ones we were interested in were out of our range We decided to take a look at roomier cars with the dealer that sold us our G6 and he informed us on a great buy with the Rendevous We ended up paying roughly  dollar30 more per month than what we were currently paying and got a roomier car all at once The other little SUVs did not have nearly the space and were charging doulbe the price We love our new car
0,After owning a 2007 A4 for just over 1 year I can firmly say that it is a really nice car but definitely not worth the sticker price of 37K I have a couple of issues car stalls for 23 seconds while cruising that the dealership cant fix I have a couple of rattles that really shouldnt exist in this caliber vehicle I got a great lease deal 400 a month  15k a year  24 months with nearly nothing down It is fun to drive Its fairly fast for the base engine The mileage is good but varies alot between city and highway
1,We traded our trusty 2002 Impala on the Buick to get more room and pull our small boat trailer So far so good Stereo system is awful Will have to replace it Will not even stay on local stations It did stall one time in traffic with no explanation Were praying this does not happen again But for the money we purchased an offlease car it still seems a bargain Mileage averaging 20mpg overall not bad for a vehicle of this size and weight
0,I recently bought my second Audi This one is an 2007 A4 that I bought as a CPO with 12G KMS It has a sport suspension with 17 in MAGS It is a great combination of style comfort and driving performance The 20 FSI has a bit of turbo lag in automatic mode but is way less noticeable than in the 18T Frankly it is no big deal as it is not very apparent and basically disappears in manual mode Interior is second to none and the handling is crisp and clean In the process of contemplating this purchase I have tried out all the competition and came back to Audi because they put everything into one great package
1,Just bought the vehicle and have noticed that at low speed with the foot off the accelerator and then trying to accelerate again the vehicle does not engage immediately I think the torque converter or accelerator electronically controlled is a problem Love the styling should have the trip computer fuel economy reading oil change time etc as standard like on my Chevy 05 Malibu Disappointed with the storage compartments in the rear and the fact the second row seats do not slide per the brochure Milage about 22 around town is excellent ride is fantastic
0,Im big the car isnt but all in all it is reasonably comfortable The AWD 6 speed 20 T gives me all the performance that I really need for Canadian winters and driving distances Mileage is excellent on the hwy in 6th and this car pulls well past the speed limit I find the fit and finish as good as my previous bimmers but the car is more reliable than my recent X5s and is actually better in the snow I reccomend this car wholeheartedly  I always enjoy driving it
1,We just bought our 3rd Rendezvous Just couldnt find a better vehicle for 20K Nothing comes close to the amount of car you get for the money OnStar Stainless exhaust Galvanized metal and seats that come out which makes more cargo room to haul things than any other SUV I get 27 mpg on the highway and have gotten 28 Hard to find one now though They are selling fast My 2002 will need replaced just in time for me to buy a Chevy Volt unless Buick comes out with something to compete with it
0,Wow this is in one word what I can say about this car Im the convertible type of woman and I previously had the bmw z4 After switching this car to Audi I dont think I will ever go back to BMWs I live in Las Vegas so sun is always here and the convertible just makes sense however from now on even if I live in Alaska I still wouldnt mind having the same car In the z4 i had to work on getting the top latched to the car and here I press a button and it does it all for me and I mean ALL Overall I love it and recommend it to anybody out there
1,I almost leased a Honda mini van The Buick has much nicer ridehandling interior radio and its seating with the second row buckets is as good as the Honda all for a lower price Im very pleased with this vehicle in my first month With the bumper to bumper of 48mo50k mi and the 60mo100k mi waranty my only concerns are resale as it will not be continued in 08
0,This is my second A4 and I fell in love all over again Just like I did when I purchased my first Audi in 2002 These cars are made to last and are only a few dollars more than a loadedup Camry I chose this time to forgo Quattro as my previous A4 Quattro ate tires for breakfast Im very happy with the FrontTrack The 20 turbo is almost as fast as my 2002 30 and gets MUCH better fuel milage 32 hwy and 2829 city I would reccommend Audi to anyone seeking a safe efficient quality auto that provides the driver with the cachet of a German luxury make without breaking the bank
1,My wife fell in love with it I was lukewarm at first I have been converted it is a great all around vehicle We have owned 7 different SUVs and this is the best riding ever 5000 miles and not one problem GM got this one right and now they are set to discontinue it and replace it with a totally different vehicle
0,The turbo 4 is plenty with the manual transmission and I average 31 mpg in mostly highway travel Handles great No problems Feels solid Over 6000 miles so far
1,The spare tire is impossible to put back once taken from under the auto The spare hangs by a crank cable system similar to other GM SUVs However directly under the spare is both a suspension strut and a part of the frame So the tire is in a small keyhole I used the spare and could not get it back into the keyhole My neighbor and I by laying on the ground under the car were able to push and pull the spare back into the key hole They should make every GM engineer who designed this do it every day
0,Only have 2000 miles in 3 months Visited the dealer on a whim after checking out Saab and VW Eos VW dealer had a used A4 on the lot Big mistake For about the same money as an Eos  I was able to lease a new A4 with Quattro I feel the value of this car with all its luxury and fit n finish puts all others to shame in this class It is a second car so it doesnt get its fair share of outdoor time I cant keep my eyes off it It turns heads on the road as well The Alpaca Beige is really unique and looks great with the aluminum trim Didnt get all bells and whistles since inventory was limited Stereo just ok Convenience pkg is great as are 18 wheels Just put the top down and grin
1,We were absolutely shocked to learn that this vehicle is the only GM vehicle including all other Buick models that includes rear seat seatbelts that do not lock unless or until it becomes necessary Subsequently small children have the ability to hang and dangle from the seatbelts Should the seatbelts reliably lock when needed not proven children are at risk for severe injury if they are not sitting upright or if the belt literally snaps them backwards Utterly ridiculous and absolutely unsafe for children We returned our vehicle within days of taking delivery All research indicates that even the slightest slack in the belt increases substantially the risk of headneck injury
0,After driving an ML320 for the past eight years it was a big decision to return to a sedan We looked at and drove many of the SUVs and cross over vehicles but werent happy with the fuel economy nor the cost so we started driving sedans We bought the A4 because of its proven AWD system in the NE winters We have 9000 miles on it so far and its been great We average 28 mpg the driving is great fun and its very responsive on curves etc The quallity of engineering is impressive and the service for the 5k oil change quick and friendly Great little car
1,I previously owned a 2005 CTS and loved it Lease was up so I purchased a used 28 with low mileage Exterior and interior appearance is great as well as the comfort ride however I just hate the 28L engine I will be planning to get another CTS 36 as soon as I can
0,After months of research I dismissed the following cars Saab 93 Volvo S40 Infiniti G35 Acura TSX It came down to the Acura TL and the A4 I bought the A4 because of the ride and I got it for  dollar3K less than the TL The car is fast but watch out for turbo lag from a standing start The quality of build is terrific Im getting 30 mpg with 70 percent hwy driving The trunk is surprisingly spacious but a little tight for the drivers right leg Get the premium package with leather seats Great fun all around
1,Ive owned the 05 and newer Accords and Camrys and the CTS is a far better vehicle for the money It is a beautiful car and not just another SEDAN Its sporty and I love it Not a single problem Father inlaw owns a 2006 and has never had any trouble So I decided it was my turn to have one
0,Have had a number of German autos our other car is a Porsche C4S and I bought the Audi as a utility vehicle and so far we are extremely pleased with the quality and performance of the car Have also had BMWs in the past the Audi is equal or better in all aspects and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a wagon for the utility benefit but still wants the style and luxury of a great German car
1,My CTS Cadillac is nothing but problems Major engine repair at 5 months and issue for over a year Then again Major engine issue at 19months The car has been a nightmare and the dealership is even worse to deal with in this regard I would never buy another Cadillac nor deal with GM I cant believe the poor level of customer service and then the poor level of quality of the car I do like the style and look of the car but it is a poor poor quality car It is upsetting as you expect a Cadillac to be the best not the worse
0,I love my new Audi It is really fun to drive and very comfortable I also feel that it is a very safe vehicle for me and my family I love the indash 6 disk changer and the body style of it When I drive past people they know that the looks impressive
1,First Cadillac Ive ever owned  picked it over an Infiniti M35 due to dealer location Sport model with 18 wheels limited chrome and spoiler definitely turns heads For the most part it performs up to its looks which is pretty decent considering its weight and 255 HP Interior is much improved in the 2008 but very plasticky in the 2007 Not up to previously owned BMW 740i Mercedes SL Jag XK or even Chrysler LHS Ride is stiff but not uncomfortable handling very good braking powerful Standard 18 summer sport tires abysmal in fallwinter which led to allseason replacement after 4000 miles at my expense Overall mileage of 192 Next vehicle Accura or Lexus midsize SUV
0,This is one great car I love how agile it is Handling is superb and it is a pleasure to drive the car This car personifies how a true German sports sedan is supposed to feel and ride The cabin is beautifully designed and the exterior is stylish and curves are eye catching The mileage I get from this car is phenomenal The only two things I would like see improved are the turbo lag and leg area is slightly tight where a bit of wider floor would increase the comfort
1,I really enjoy the sporting look and feel of the car as it is very responsive with an excellent turning radius However the interior noise is annoying at speeds around 4247 miles per hour you will hear a slight humming noise I am going back for the second timeime to have this looked at I am not happy about the noise level with the inside cabin ride Just not up to standards of Cadillac
0,I selected the wood trim instead of the aluminum The car is very fun to drive and Quattro is amazing The fact that you can get it nicely equipped at about 46k is pretty nice too I had the Premium and Convenience Packages along with the Bose sound system No MMI or Bluetooth However Bluetooth is pointless in a convertible if you have the top down The wind deflector and heated seats are invaluable and they help you drive the car a lot later into the year Digital climate control is standard a nice touch over BMW or Mercedes The CD player is an indash 6 disc The changer moves to the glovebox if you get MMI It also plays MP3 discs which is handy
1,This vehicle drives well but does not reach the EPA mileage Has the larger engine not the V8 and performs well Noisy inside on rough roads  the combo of shocks suspension and body results in some annoying reverberation over bumps There was no plan for the back seat passenger AC  on a par with the cheapest Chevy on the lot If you want the back seat cooled you have to run the AC fans on high and freeze out the front seat Trunk does not have the closer system  it needs a big slam to shut
0,I recently bought the A4 20T CVT previously I had an A4 2001 28 V6 I liked that car a lot but this new one is more powerful Even though is 4 cyl it has 10 HP more than my previous V6 Exterior and interior design is awesome I got 6 years 100000 miles of warranty for certified cars only so I can drive nonstop and have fun The only thing that my old car has the advantage over the new one is a silent engine noise I believe it because of the turbo I like more silent powerful engines but otherwise everything is just excellent AAA
1,I bought this car because it was American At first I thought it looked cool but after 3 months the styling looks outdated and ugly The engine is weak and could use some hints from BMW The interior function is not impressive for the misplacing of buttons I was going to look at the new CTS but it looks like a 70 year old would be driving it I am ready to trade it in for a BMW 335 something that will acually make me feel under 60 years old
0,Ive owned three VWs before this and so far Im in love with the A4 I miss the power off the line from the VR6 engine in the VWs I drove but this is my first turbo and part of it is a personal adjustment Would I purchase one again if I had the choice Yes I love the way it handles the ergonomics and interior design are excellent and the build quality is top notch I only wish that I had an S4 or an RS4 It leaves me with something to wish for but thats not a bad thing
1,The 28L V6 is OK XM Radio OnStar great Imrovement from leatherette to full leather small 36 marginally faster Greatfirst car Way cooler than CamryAccord
0,The A4 can justify the price and gives the owner a sense of exclusivity I wanted a sensible economy car and thats exactly what I got Its not overly fun to drive doesnt have dropdead good looks but it is reliable has excellent fuel economy and the fit and finish set the standard The Audi is an all around good car and I have never secondguessed myself for purchasing one
1,Great ride tight suspension Cadillac brand whats not to like Performance is there quality built and I love the black mesh grille and 18 in wheels
0,After 9 years and 150K miles 8 12 years and 142K miles with nothing but routine maintenance it was time to retire my 98 A4 28 Audi BMW Acura Lexus and Infiniti were all on my list to consider The Audi turned out to be the best allaround vehicle and as I mentioned has proven to be ultrareliable at least for me I love the 32s growl and pickup
1,The car looks nice enough but interior design needs help may as well put the radio and AC panels   and controls on the floor since it is necessary to turn   and look down to see them The seat belt buckle is difficult to find jammed up by the center console The plastic interior is poor quality for a LUX car The ride is smooth the engine power is good steering could be tighter This car rides and handles no better than my base 01 De Ville and lacks the comfort The controls in the arm rest are poor design resting my arm on it the windows go down and the controls are touchy There are too many DIC switches The tire monitor has stopped working Rear visibility past the rear doors down the side
0,I recently purchased a 2007 Audi A4 20T six speed with the sport package This car is simply awesome There is virtually no turbo lag The acceleration is simply breathtaking It is hard to believe that this car has only has 200 hp It feels more like 250 hp The six speed will do 060 in 65 secs but feels even faster when the temp outside is between 40 50 degrees  turbos like cool weather The passing acceleration is equally impressive Just drop down a gear and whoosh the turbo blasts the car forward leaving other cars in your wake I am also impressed with the handling capabilities of the A4 Many of the components of the sport suspension are borrowed from the S4 and it shows
1,How GM can continue to produce garbage like this and still stay in business eludes me This is the second new Cadillac Ive owned my 04Deville was a total lemon and I thought it was an anomaly unfortunately it wasnt my 07 is an even bigger lemon I dont know where to start the car breaks down almost constantly everything from electrical to drivetrain even the heated seats broke The front wheel drive system axils seals and transmission are a mess The car spends more time in the shop than in my garage If I was to give a complete list of everything thats been repaired on this car it would take an hour to read About all this car does is look good standing still
0,Words alone cannot describe the artwork this car is From the moment you sit in the car you feel comfort and to the point of making turns at 60 mph you still feel the ground which gives you believe in the car you trust it in the most severe time and it doesnt let you down 4 cylinder engine great on gas especially now that will hit  dollar4 a gallon and does not compromise power 200 hp is quite enough The interior as always high quality
1,Fake leather dash and door panels too much plastic uncomfortable seats The optional bench seats have no lateral support the seat is too short and does not support my legs and I cannot find a comfortable position The passenger seat is similar Our previous DeVille 2002 had much better seats than this one The steering wheel is heated but the leather cover does not extend to the 10 and 2 oclock driving areas Also the instruments and console are difficult to read while wearing sun glasses and we really need them in Texas The luxury options are great but overall were really disappointed with what theyve done to this car
0,This is a great car but it does have a few problems The biggest problem so far is the fuel economy granted I live in NYC but 230 miles to the tank still seems like a bit much for a manual transmission being carefully driven Now the fun part at 4953 the check engine light came on and as I soon found out the oxygen sensor was broken This would have to be the first time I have ever had anything break at 5000 miles and needless to say I was not pleased Still pretty happy with the car though an overall pleasant drive
1,This is our 5th DTS and it is by far the very best Black on black So quiet its hard to believe Why someone would not buy or lease this luxury car is beyond me They have acheived a blend of all that a luxury auto should be in this car I highly recommend tis wonderful American made automobile
0,Did my research Audi A4 wins in most categories fun to drive yet economical great design aspects but not too cuttingedge very comfortable ride and of course excellent German engineering throughout Its damn good looking too
1,I took a 2000 mile trip a month after I purchased the vehicle and I was not impressed with the handling or functioning of the vehicle Navigation system worked fine there but was inoperative on the way back I was only able to select pointto point not selected roads Stability control allows too much sway on turns not near as good as my 1995 Eldorado ETC Icons and Switches Switches on the Armrest are poorly placed and poorly labeled Heating and Ventilation Poor design for the controls The Air Conditioning blows cold air even when it is 30 degrees outside and the car is first started The 1995 Eldorado controls were Set and Forget
0,I just recently bought my Audi and I am extremely satisfied I love the car how it runs performs handles everything
1,The levels of engine and road noise are still excessive in the current DTS especially when compared to the Town Car Mercedes Benz and Lexus models There is still too much NVH feedback through the steering wheel A couple of times when making a sharp Uturn it felt as if the drive belt slipped resulting in the temporary failure of the power steering Another annoyance is a squeak caused by the front seat back rubbing against the stationary center armrest console when encountering bumps Get the bench seat option if you hate squeaks Cadillac knows of the problem since the side of the seat bottom cushion contacting the console is covered in fabric I will consider another DTS in 09
0,Very satisfied with my new 07 A4 32Q SLine and titanium pkg Ive received glowing remarks on the Quartz metallic exterior and most people get the smooth quality interior Ive got the Navigation system with Sirius radio and enjoy every minute in this fun to drive rocket As many have mentioned the 32 engine has serious pull and the suspension keeps the car hugging the curves The seamless bluetooth technology is just another added creature comfort so is the MP3 compatibility Love this car
1,This car rides and handles much better than I expected For its size comfort and economical operations I cannot think of a better choice I use the car to transport customers on trips between 10 miles to over 100 miles I always hear comments like how come they dont sell more of these I am never ashamed to use this vehicle with my clients
0,Ive purchased this vehicle about a week ago I was also looking at Acura TL Infiniti G35 and Lexus IS 250 as well In my opinion Acura had the best quality and price However Audi was much more fun to drive and has AWD feature which is very helpful for me I live in Boston I am satisfied with my vehicle
1,I sold my 2003 Infiniti Coupe for an 2007 Escalade fully loaded Black on Black with 60k miles for about  dollar32k plus taxes and fees I rented an 2009 from Hertz in Feb and I just had to have one of my own This is a weekend car I am 26yo engaged and I wanted a car to sit 7 people I got the extended warranty on it Gas mileage in NYC driving is roughly 280 miles on 22gal without AC or spirited driving Wind noise can be heard above 65MPH At startups the rear back on the truck makes loud noise electrical for about 30 seconds But besides that it is great on the road uneven pavement and pot holes Mine has the 18 chrome wheel but I am looking to upgrade to the stock 22
0,After 4500 miles the engine on my A4 developed a knock on the passenger side Audi has replaced the air pump ECU and is now replacing the cylinder head I am concerned that such a new motor has failed and that Audi has instructed the dealer to break it open and repair it rather then replace the motor or vehicle
1,Absolutely the best SUV and has lived up to all of our greatest expectations over last 2 years Definitely recommend it I was 9 months pregnant during the test drives  it had the only comfortable seats many A compliments to GM Love the growlpurr of the engine great looks sporty handling   and acceleration Only 1 gripe  hate the lawyers version of the DVDNAVAUDIO Its ridiculous that you have to come to a complete stop to use many features scroll XM stations calls destination etc when there is a passenger to do it without causing distraction for the driver Could utilize the front onoff airbag switch to unfreeze the features while in motion Hate that on the highway
0,Have owned the car for 6 days and love it Went with FWD and CVT due to price  wanted a convertible and this is a 3rd car that will not do heavy duty driving or commuting For general driving the FWD is more than fine Engine is great with 20T  peppy and efficient at same time Brotherinlaw owns 05 18T Sedan  drove my 20T   and says its much stronger from a standstill Upgraded stereo with BoseSirius is fabulous Interior fitfeel is intuitive with lots of little features that make it a pleasure to drive Top up down process is painless and takes less that 30 seconds Overall no regrets and the price was right compared to a used 2006 BMW convertible
1,Traded my04Denali for this and have been disappointedTook major downgrade in bells and whistles which is just wrong for the price Wifes 02 Trailblazer has more Seats are hard small and uncomfortable Traded because Denali seats had no support and Escalade is like sitting on a box GMs new improved rain sensing wipers are terribleWatch the car in front  you will hit it before it wipes Wind noise is pathetic I know it is a big box but come on My friends Expedition is soooo much quieter The third row seats weigh a ton Majir pain to take in and out When out the big plastic strips that seats ride on are in the way GM saved a few bucks with no light in glovebox or under hood
0,I just turnedin my 2004 A4 18T UltraSport 5speed manual and am very excited I decided to go for CVT this time and with a few less options This car does not disappoint it looks great drives great etc
1,I have tried to support the American car manufacturer but I cant anymore I have had everything from havng to replace the console because it was rattling so much too the cheap plastic Door handles that cut my wifes hand The molding around the windows is falling apart Then the recalls the last one because the unit that heated the windshield wiper fluid had heated up while not in use and apparently had started fires These are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg many other things have gone wrong but I am getting depressed even more by continuing on Needless to say I love General Motors but until they improve quality I will no longer be a loyal buyer
0,I have had this car two months and I love driving it This car is really nimble and comfortable The gas mileage is pretty good for a car that performs this well There is a slight lag at take off but then it really picks up Also the car beeps way too much For the money this is a great car
1,When we saw the new 07 escalade we just had to have it The vehicle turns many heads it looks good but the workmanship can be better The horrible wind noise and when we take it in for service they dont hear it The third row seats are very hard to fold up and take out dont know if we would purchase a escalade again maybe we just got a rotten Apple from the orchard
0,A long time Benz owner  drove the Audi on a whim and fell in love I had forgotten how much fun driving could be  this thing rides like its on rails Bought it as a 2nd car to keep miles off my ML350 and have to force myself to drive the SUV now
1,This is my second Escalade and I was really excited about it I bought a fully loaded awd black black The problem is the transmission feels as though its going to fall out of the carthe wors shifting ever I manually shifted to see what gear 4 and 5th are the worst Also the 55 lbs seatsI mean come onmy 125lb wife has no chance at getting them inout This car really is disappointing and they will feel it
0,With the new 32 A4 Audi has designed in my opinion the BMWkiller This car outdoes the 3series in three important categories of performance appearance and overall value with handling being a tie Im so glad I kicked in the extra few thousand to get the 6cyl over the buzzy little turbo 4 cyl It was well worth it as the six gives you an extra 55 naturallyaspirated HP which is noticeable on hilly roads as well as in passing situations I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
1,I had the misfortune of choosing probably the worst Escalade in the lot When I see all these 10 ratings in performance form other customers I just feel like crying Just bought a 2007 Escalade I always wanted to have a Cadillac I had a Navigator before which I loved  but the new ones are so ugly The Escalade is so impresive and beautiful But is probably the worst ride I ever hadstarting with the loud wind noise busy and rough shifting and having to step on it to get some kind of speed I regret this buy big time Dealer cannot reproduce the problem I wany my Chrysler Pacifica back
0,Just got an A4 20T 6MT as my 2nd car due to its attractive lease deal I wasnt an Audi fan   and never like quattro or FWD cars My previous driving expriences on 1st Gen S4 was soso only I was always thought of getting a BMW 3 series as my daily After I owned this A4 for a few weeks I fell in love with the new 07 A4 Its suspension is so composed even with the base 16 wheeltire setup the suspension setting is firm yet comfortable Handling is neutral to very minimal understeer Overall experience is very good on par with the last 3 series I drove The 6MT shifts better than any BMW period Now with  dollar100 lower on monthly payment I totally forget about the BMW and Im loving it
1,I have had the LX470 Hummer h2 sut test drove the Lincoln Navigator The Lincoln was my second choice as I pull a boat and the LX470 is sorry to tow 6000 lbs I went into the Caddy pessimistic because of the plastic wood and the uncomfortable seats and a stiffer than expected suspension My Hummer was smoother The Navigator dash design is horrible and the rear entertainment system looks like an aftermarket install The Escalade will grow on you It is the best SUV on the market There isnt a better user friendly Nav entertainment system If you do not choose this option you are missing out I went in with a 2 year lease waiting for the new LX I am staying with Caddy
0,This is my first Audi and so far Im very pleased The overall muscular look of the exterior and refined interior was what attracted me The turbo engine has plenty of power especially in s mode Interior controls are well laid out and the dual climate control works exceptionally well  very cold AC The ride is rather quiet and wind noise is relatively unnoticeable Fuel economy is a bit less than advertised I do mostly highway driving at 6070 mph and I have been getting 30 mpg versus 32 mpg advertised Overall Im very pleased with the value and quality of this car
1,I love the interior and exterior The transmission is jumpybangs at trafficlower speeds stopgo  10mph and less Ive averaged about 115 mpg and have about 5500 miles on the vehicle so far The wind noise on the drivers side is very pronounced I dont buy the excuse that its the mirrors as its not 12 as loud on the passengers side Overall I wish I had stuck with a new Denali XL or gone with the Benz GL
0,This is my first Audi I always had an impression of Audi being a softer BMW and all in all I think I was correct After having owned many performance cars I was looking for something more comfortable for my long drives so I decided to check out Audi This is definitely a comfortable car You get a fair amount of luxury good performance great gas mileage and a beautiful car inside and out for the money all without the unwanted image the BMW provides which frankly I got tired of If you want a more performance oriented car the 3series is cream of the crop however if you want a more compliant German made car the A4 is a great car for less money
1,I bought this vehicle in April 06 I loved the new style The remote start and remote lift gate are great Navigation and XM radio also great I also love the climatecontrolled front seats heated steering wheel and heated rear seats GM still cant figure out flat folding 3rd seats though And no auto up windows Come on Also I hate that it has no telescoping steering wheel My driver door had rattle since day one I have been to dealer five times and they cant stop it Now I have a vibration in the front dash too And the brakes squeak terribly in cool damp weather The dealer looked at them twice and says nothing can be done This is my fourth GM vehicle but first with squeaky brakes  and its a Caddy Overall I like the vehicle but am not sure that Id get another one
0,This is my first sedan I never thought Id get one but I truly like my Audi Going from a V6 engine has been my only real adjustment The lag still bothers me a bit but once you pick up speed wow The car really moves I had considered a BMW but Audi had a better deal and I am very pleased with my car Its a classy car
1,I have had this vehicle for about six months and I have to say that it is the best vehicle that I have ever owned My last vehicle was an Expedition and the motor driving interior exterior of the Escalade are many times better Great job in making me look so good while driving my vehicle Just one thing bothers me actually two One is the fact that a vehicle like mine does not have a fuel button I have to go outside and the engine key is so not Cadillac while other lesser vehicles have push button start ups and all sort of nice keys Cadillacs is disappointing Besides that this is the best large SUV on the freeway
0,This is my 8th leased Audi Love the brand The 32 Cab is a great car to drive Ive had Porsche and BMW convertibles and nothing can compare to the amazing roof this Audi has Its canvas but virtually silent even when driving at 80 mph I dont know how the engineers did it but wind noise is kept at a minimum Handling is much better than the old cabs It seems stiffer and the turnin is quicker Brakes are awesome and inspire confidence Got it in Alpaka Beige cream interior and tan room Its a very nice looking car even with the new Audi gapmouth grille You get used to that fairly quickly I highly recommend the 32
1,I have had problems with chopping the outside edge of the front tires The tailgate on the EXT just falls open The edge at the back of the tailgate is higher than the gate itself a design flaw
0,Being a previous owner of a Passat I was not particularly excited about taking delivery of this car I was a BMW zealot and still have a late model bimmer parked next to the Audi but got excited very excited about driving this car The Quattro is a godsend  much better than Xdrive The fit and finish is superb The creature comforts well matched This car is a winner Its dichotomous nature is aptly suited to both the executive who thinks he could drive in a rally and to the retiree who likes a sport tuned suspension with the confidence of knowing they have allwheel ability One will not be disappointed with this car Enjoy and cheers
1,I like the car a lot except that the wind and road noise are really bad A friend I took on a long road trip said his two year old Tahoe is much quieter Sad but I have to agree with him The dealer adjusted the doors once but it didnt help Is there a fix out there
0,What other vehicle in this class offers luxury performance safety cachet fuel economy and quality at the price of an A4 BMW arguably makes a superior car but the value is not there and how will you know which one is yours in the parking lot MB lacks quality The Japanese makes dont offer the driving experience of the Germans and the Americans are sans cachet To me the A4 fills a neat niche left by the others with an incredible drivetrain legendary ergonomics earth and walletsaving fuel economy IIHS safety cred and lease deals galore its a nobrainer Drive everything else first
1,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is one teriffic vehicle I puchased all the available options with no regret Finally a car company not afraid to put in a remote engine starter as standard fair Dont even get me started on the awsome cooled seats I found about 15 little features that arent even documented did you know the heatair fan automatically slows quiets when you make a phone call so the noise doesnt interfere with the call How about just touching the turn indicator for half a second and the turn indicator continues to flash 4 additional times Cool stuff The ride in this vehicle is truly the best This truck is worth the expense I love the new look and interior
0,Second A4 Ive owned and it keeps getting better and better Love the design the engine the interior Still notice the turbo lag but not as pronounced as my 05 A4 18L The car will get up and move when asked and is very responsive and I love to hear the growl of the engine Until audi does something really bad to these cars Ill always buy another audi Will always recommend audi before other luxury cars also
1,I traded in my 2003 Escalade for the new 07 model When I first saw them I wasnt sold but after a closer look and examining the interior I was sold This truck is greatits scary how much Cadillac stepped up their game to compete with Lexus and Infiniti The previous models had kiddie interior layouts but this layout meets the money that you pay for the truck I am very pleased and have no regrets about spending the extra money
0,I have had my A4 for a month and it handles any curve in any condition The allwheel drive is great I upgraded to the sport suspension and it really makes the ride more firm so make sure that you really want that as the regular suspension is already pretty good and sometimes I think I would not mind a little softer ride although it does allow you to take a corner at 75 and makes it feel like 25 The inside is way better then the BMW or Acura Great car overall with a great style all its own If you go to the snow this car is great I have already taken it to tahoe and while others were putting on chains I just kept on driving
1,Cadillac has done a nice job of restyling the Escalade but unfortunately they have a way to go to beat their Japanese competitors The outside is beuatiful and the inside looks good but looks can be deceiving There is almost no storage room in the back the rear windows only open part way the sideboard windows not at all The upgraded stereo is marginal and little things like the cuip holders are still cheap and not what you would expect on a vehicle at this cost Gas mileage to date is terrible around 11 12 miles per gallon in mixed cityhiway traffic There are a number of rattles in the vehicle as well All things considered I would have expected more from a vehicle at this price
0,I have now owned my 6th Audi 4th A4 and I will say for sure Audi has come back to be the overall segment leader in the compact luxury car segment for the total package I have already put over 5K miles on the car without a hitch just got the first scheduled service for free Even being front drive this car handles extremely well and the performance is much greater than expected for a 4 cylinder thanks to direct injection The base stereo system rocks as well as the Bose stereo from previous A4s Heated seats arent really necessary in Arizona but have come in handy on a few cool nights Overall fit and finish is unmatched by any other cars in class
1,This truck is the best I think as far as SUVs go it stands alone Its in a class by itself The only way to know how good this truck is is to own one I have had many other SUVs and the 07 Escalade just takes you on another journy If you dont own one you are missing out
0,I bought this car for my daughter who previously had a Volvo S40 and a Volvo S60 Both are very good safe cars but lack any sense of excitement I drive a Porsche and when it was in for service I was given an A4 as a loaner and loved it Tight as a drum wellbalanced great handling outstanding gas mileage and really fun to drive I grab it whenever I can Excellent build quality great exterior design and an interior way beyond anything in its price class Buy it
1,Enjoyed the dealer experience But when you have a pile of crap like the ESV to sell they wont be in business long Had in shop more than we have driven her The rear windshield washer wiper now wont work Horrible gas mileage and the auto transmission shifts into higher gear too guickly If you have to buy this sized SUV get a used Sub or Yuk Wouldnt own another trust me
0,After a bad experience with my 2006 BMW and the run flat tires my third BMW I researched many cars to see what would be the BMWs replacement When I drove the Audi A4 32 quattro I knew I would never go back to BMW The car handles better better ride quiet large trunk great storage and many useful features Its an all around awesome car and Im looking forward to many years of driving enjoyment
1,I bought this for my wife we have 52000 miles on it now and we have really enjoyed it We had very little trouble wit this truck I would buy another one in a heart beat
0,I love driving this car It has a great feel and handles very well on back country roads
1,I will start by saying I love the look of this SUV It looks sharp coming down the road Beautiful design But we have had nothing but trouble with this vehicle It has been in the shop more than I can count I usually wait until 34 things are wrong before I put it in the shop now The wind noise is unbelievable It is extremely loud on the highway on a windy day If you are wanting a quiet vehicle this is not it We have never paid this much for a vehicle and have been nothing but disappointed Seems like the designers could have worked out all of the wind noise before they produced the car We are trading it in very soon and hoping for a quieter vehicle with less trouble
0,I found my stylish sporty and comfortable A4 is a lot of car for the money
1,We bought the 2007 Escalade ESV as a step up from our Durango We absolutely loved it Starting the next day after signing the problems started Keyless remote start wouldnt work then the heated seats quit not once but 3 different times the airconditioner wasnt working the module for the tire pressure quit working the heat in the back quit working and more We have now owned this thing for 3 months and its been in the shop over 30 of those days on 9 different occassions I would never ever buy another one 70K wastedsigh
0,I have had this car for 4 months and every day I seem to find a new reason to like it better than the day before It is a beautifully refined vehicle and the interior along with the convertible top is a marvel The engine is smooth although maybe a little noisy and the 6speed auto transmission is very refined I wish the gas mileage were a little better but that is the compromise to have Quattro I guess I have pretty much every available option and I think this is the reason the car is such a marvel nothing to do but drive and enjoy
1,I have had my 2007 ESV for almost a year and after spending almost  dollar70000 on it I am extremely disapponted For a company that brags about the quietest ride ever it is loudest vechicle I have ever been in The wind noise is so bad that I am thinking of trading it in already I have had it into the dealer 5 times with to no avail It sounds like the windows are rolled down and the wind is blowing 90 mph I wouldnt recommend that anyone buy this ESV until some MAJOR changes happen
0,Start with the engine  20 liter mated to the 6 spd and the Quattro drive astonishing torque and smoothness for the size Turbo lag is virtually eliminated with DFI Low end grunt is not awesome but its not to be expected The exterior is a matter of taste  I love the design Interior is very quiet comfortable well appointed
1,This SUV is way beyond what I had expected It has dramatically changed from the previous model Everything is better more dramatic in design No one can mistake this SUV for any other
0,Truly a thinking mans BMW Sure it has FF format and it doesnt quite drive like FR BMW but it has a confident handling and ride quality that many drivers wouldnt really mind at all And how about the price point It is several thousands dollars less than BMW but I think it has much more tasteful interior that will age gracefully Wonderful car to drive and look at
1,OK well I am an avid Escalade cheerleader I have owned one for seven years and decided to buy the 2007 model Hmmmm well the interior looks so huge because they took out the soft plush seats and replaced them with crappy flat uncomfortable seats It drives like a bus parking it in a tight parking spot at the grocery store is scary to say the least The bells and whistles are great 22s navigation XM radio two DVDs but come on if the base package isnt right who cares about the bells and whistles Come on the 2007 Escalade is not a true Cadillac Save you money buy a 2003  2006 model of Escalade I PROMISE you wont be disappointed
0,I really have a hard time describing to nonAudi Quattro drivers the experience of Audi Quattro In the wet snow and ice this all wheel drive saves you in so many situations and this system does this in a manner in which the driver has no clue  it just works This is not four wheel drive as I have often heard the neophyte describe controlled power to four wheels On dry pavement this is total smart control  Quattro is an all wheel computer controlled drive perfected over 25 years and banned on many race circuits because of its dominant superiority With seamless traction like a Cheetah coupled with an engine that is FSI turbocharged and intercooled race bred in an everyday spo
1,The escalade ESV is a great family SUV One problem is that there arent that many interior options Also the seats get dirty very easily It takes regular unleaded fuel so there are no worries about the high cost of Premium My truck gets 12 mpg city and 17 mpg highway
0,First type of entry level luxury car Fun to drive responsive and comfortable Would buy again if they continued with this type of quality in the car Good pricing options and the packages they offer are excellent They have me hooked for sure not to mention it has a decent room for passengers in the back
1,After 20  years of Silverados I decided to upgrade to an EXT since Ive retired and dont really need a working truck any more Im completely satisfied with the looks performance comfort and handling I pull a travel trailer occasionally and need the power so mileage wasnt really a concern At this point I dont see my going to any other type if and when I purchase another one
0,First Audi and after 1500 miles Im sold Couldnt be happier with the drive and feel of the A4 Handles amazing great gas mileage and an appealing look  both interior and exterior Test drove the 325xi and not much difference  actually the interior styling and price are superior with the A4 The interior controls take a little getting used to climate controls audio lights and sunroof control
1,this truck is lots of fun it gets up to speed like most cars so it doesnt feel like you are actually driveing a full size truck and the remote start and ac seats make summer time enjoyfull for a black on black truck
0,The car drives great It has tight handling and responsive control its easy to operate and the controls are great Its a beautiful car
1,This is my second EXT and I think this truck looks and rides great I kinda liked the body armor that the 05 had but Ill get used to it As far as mileage you dont buy a truck like this for economy Still Cadillac needs to stop cutting corners and go all out we will buy it even if it cost more
0,This thing is soo fun Ive had an MB C230 before and it cant even compare to my 07 A4 20t Its really fast with the sport mode trans and so easy to drive while maintaining complete control Awesome brakes too Sweet sound system and cool lighting while driving at night
1,I traded in my 04 EXT for this 07 The 07 has much better fit and finish and the new engine is very powerful I am not crazy about the 6 speed trans because it is always shifting and I am experiencing a severe vibration when in overdive The dealer I bought this from has a top notch service department and they think this might have something to do with the trans or the differential either way it only has 1000 miles on it and there shouldnt be anything wrong
0,Just got the car so this is my initial reaction review After I drive it a year or so Ill put in another review But right now I LOVE this car The handling is great the steering wheel adaptive steering is a godsend the color deep blue pearl is beautiful the acceleration is strong and the engine roar is sexy too bad Im still breaking it in so nothing over 5000 rpm yet and the safety and interior features are very well designed I personally liked how the manual drove on this car than the 2006 325xi and the Quattro system is much better I think this car is a keeper
1,The 2007 Escalade EXT is my 3rd Cadillac truck I miss the sun visors from prior models My 2003 had two visors with a pull out for the 3rd visor Now there is only one and you are forced to set in a different position to keep the Florida sun out of your eyes The tailgate is a total design flop The painted surface sticks up higher than the black deck If you use it as a TRUCK you will soon see all the paint gone on the edge of the tail gate Probably like all vehicles the price went up and the quality went down hill
0,I have only logged 400 miles but I am sold on the A4 The car is a pleasure to drive and much sportier than expected I shopped the 3 series as well and dollar for dollar the A4 just felt like the better package It is hard to explain but just feels good to drive this car It has multiple personalities based on the way you shift the automatic but all are enjoyable I like to use the manual mode to get to speed quickly and then shift to D The car really rewards you when you hit the back roads it feels stuck to the road but rides very comfortably As far as the interior goes it is nearly perfect from an ergonomic stand point and I love the bluetooth with my Blackberry 8700
1,Good looks and convienient very useful cargo space or 3rd seat kids love it too small for adults but this is a crossover anyway not a minivan front looks outdated it should have been more like 07 cts just a minor facelift could have been a tremendous benefit Full of anoying electrical glitches sunroof backs up when rear windoes are closing cant be fixed seat belt jammed and replaced twice Dont buy this car wo a warranty Very good handling and performance for its size but slow compare to 2010 RSX Electric rear seats are a slow it should have been manual like acura MDX Need better care to built and fix minor problems Poor mileage I would buy another one if improved
0,Does everything well I enjoy driving this car Gets great gas mileage no turbo lag amazing handling
1,Steering wheel can not be adjusted towards driver If you like to have steering wheel close to you and you are tall knees will push against the dashboard and keys Seating is rather sports car than SUV legs will be very high TERRIBLE leg room for the front passenger  check the narrowing on the left Navigation system is lousy touch screen is very nonresponsive route pink is colored almost the same as the other roads red very frustrating  trying to find something on map manually with assisting windows popping up wo need and making the search area narrow 3rd row seating only suits small kids 2nd row mid seat tall passenger bumps head against switches Resale value  disaster
0,Awesome car that handles like its on rails The new 20T transmission mated with the manual is a joy to drive and has all the power you need The cars interior is topnotch All in all a wonderful car for the price
1,I had not bought an American car since the late 1980s and was afraid to try it again But this car was such a looker drove so well and was priced so attractively that I couldnt turn it up I have been very happy with the car with the exception of the gas mileage I do a mix of about half cityhalf highway driving and I manage to average 1516 mpg On the freeway I get 2123 mpg depending on roadweather conditions I think the car could probably benefit from a slightly larger wheel size but as that would only decrease MPG I am happy enough with what it came with
0,I leased the Audi A4 20T CVT with premium package and I was amazed by the powerful engine fuel economy and interior quality It is fun to drive and a very good looking car
1,Weve owned Cadillacs over 30 years but this is first crossover vehicle It is exceptionally efficient on ice and snow Would I buy another SRX Probably not When I have passengers in the SRX there is no place for my purse except in cargo area which is very inconvenient Mileage per gallon is poor and the small gas tank requires frequent stops to buy gasoline Rear entry door is exceedingly slow opening and closing Aluminum trim on heat vents on dash reflect and glare badly in both outside rear view windows a serious problem Lacks interior dash control for rear entry door very inconvenient
0,I had an Audi A6 27 2000 which I loved and was very much the sports car The A6 32 2008 is not as sporty but is a great car to drive The sound system is the best Ive ever owned The gas mileage is unbelievable with in city averaging over 21 and highway over 30 The car is great car for trips and would highly recommend it to anyone
1,After being with Audi Mercedes and Infiniti for the last 16 years the SRX is a great find We picked up a slightly used SRX4 with just under 1600 miles for  dollar11K under list We also opted for the Cadillac certification so we have 5 years of  dollar0 decuctible bumpertobumper warranty on it I have already brought it in to address a couple of items like the sunroof being slowstuck and the clock being noisy sunroof motor and clock replaced wo questions The interior is just about as luxurious as the germans my 12 year old likes curling up in the 3rd row after tiring sports and the V8 performs If it only got 25 mpg it would be perfect
0,The A6 42 is my first German luxury sedan having previously enjoyed both Volvo and Acura sedans The A6 clearly outclasses and outperforms these models as it should for its premium price Overall I am very pleased with this car after 20000 miles It has been mechanically sound is safe and comfortable has classic euro lux sedan good looks and delivers great performance Two things have really impressed me First the quattro AWD  it performs in all weather conditionsI wont have another car without AWD Second fuel economy  it is very good for a powerful V8 I often get 2628 on the highway even when Im pushing the pace The navigation and MMII systems are lackluster
1,This car reminds me of the NY Yankees On paper it just cant be beat On the road and day to day there are some glaring misses Unless this is fixed in the next model year I will not buy again Now my detail A great handler Excellent solid feel of the road Beautful look and touch Quiet and smooth ride Now the problem 1 Terrible heat and air control for back seats 2 No button to open the hatch you have to use the remote and that takes practice 3 with the rear ent system you only get 1 cddvd Just one whats the deal with that 43rd row electric seat is a death march and not simple either Nothing like waiting 3 minutes in the rain for a seat
0,This is my 2nd certified used Audi A6 the 1st was an Avant that I kept until 185000 miles and it still drove like new This 2007 certified used Audi had 27000 miles when I bought it and I havent had a single problem All the power I can use and all I do is think about passing and the next thing I know Im past in absolute silence and total control The brakes are amazing but rather touchy and take some getting used to I average 27 mpg and 32 on the highway doing 7075 Nav is fast accurate and easy Bose radio rocks steering and handling great My speedometer is 3 mph fast and the front cupholders arent great  otherwise nothing compares for this 62 220 pounder
1,I love this car with a few minor exceptions With the sport package the 20 inch wheels and all black outside there are not very many better looking SUVs on the road With the V8 its just plain fast But I am only getting 135 MPG less than in the Escalade I traded in And the Escalade took regular gas Seats could be a bit more comfortable but not bad
0,My car is actually the Audi A6 20 TSI and it has what it takes to make it big among its German stablemates The design flair is obvious keep it conservative but let it age with style The build quality has improved from my 2000 Audi A6 with the feel of this car leaning more towards the A8 than it does to the A4 The handling is still nimble and oh so much fun in Sshift especially when taking off at the lights The Jekyll and Hyde personality shift is scary The sound system is pure pleasure and adds to the ambience of the car that is until things start going wrong
1,The V8 engine works well on flat straight roads With the mountain driving I do the 6 speed is geared too high and it continously losses powers and shifts even in the S mode In a 25 mile stretch of mountain driving the engine shifted 40 times in regular drive and 33 times in the s mode Very dissappointed in the performance of this car The back up warning is useless the is only a audio warning when you are within 12 to 18 inches of an object and only if your reverse speed is 3 to 5 mph Otherwise you are required to look about the back window for lights to determine if there is something behind you
0,I researched all german and japanese sedans in the  dollar40000 to  dollar60000 range and Audi was one of the last I drove I have been driving BMWs since the late 70s owning the 3 and 5 series Audis A6 reliability got better reviews the last few years so I checked it out Its very nimble powerful and just plain fun to drive plus its stylish Being a female color is important and I love the amaretto interior Bose sound system cranks too
1,This is my first Cadillac I always thought of it as an older persons vehicle I have one child who plays hockey and so I felt the SRX was a great size for room and comfort on road trips I am only getting 15 miles to the gallon with a V6 but so far that is the only disappointing feature
0,Ive driven Acuras for 15 years Vigor TL and loved them My new 2007 A6 42 is my first German car and I love it I wanted a 4WD vehicle with large engine and room to fit my bike I started looking at the BMW X5 Acura RL and MDX and the Lexus RX I liked the X5 a lot but really preferred a sedan When I discovered the A6 had 350 hp beautiful interior and an enormous trunk I was in My test drive sealed the deal Ive had the car for 6 weeks and 1400 mi and am loving every minute Its fun to drive with tons of power and lots of class Im sure Ill feel some pain in the wallet for service but Audis service contract eases that a bit A big thumbsup for Audi
1,This is my 3rd or 4th Cadillac lost count but it is surely my last one This little STS has had one annoying problem after anotherand NO MILES ON IT This evening it has shut down completely and doesnt recognize fobs wont open the trunk or move out of PARK Road Side Assistance sent a tow truck out to carry the car back to the dealer but the tow driver couldnt budge the car out of PARK Thankfully we are home and have a second vehicle Toyota so we arent stranded Now if this was happening at a mall or anywhere on the road this incident would be more than infuriating I would not advise anyone to buy a Cadillac
0,I have had this car for 3 months and 2100 miles city and highway driving It is easy to maneuver solid in good and bad weather very comfortable and very stylish The MMI has become second nature and is really a lot of fun The car has computer power that exceeds many desktops
1,I leased this car and within the first year the car was in the shop for over 30 days It was first a recall then rattles in the trunk that took three tries to fix then a blown speaker then Homelink failures Unbelievable I was never offered anything for my troubles by the dealer or GM Bottom line I traded for a 2008 335i BMW sedan and could not be happier BMW offers so much more for the money Imagine that a BMW more affordable and a better value than a Cadillac The original list on the Caddy was  dollar65000 and it wholesaled after I traded it in for  dollar25000 and only after 13 months
0,Excellent design inside and out understated class At home at the market or country club Fit and finish is incredible The 18 wheels look the best and are surprisingly smooth on the road Would encourage wheel insurance though as theyre easy to nick and scuff Interior screams luxury  well appointed and roomy MMI control is much easier to learn than critics sayUpgraded Bose audio is concert hall quality with the surround sound selection Bluetooth works like a dream Adaptive headlights are very bright Good acceleration and braking Quattro AWD gives excellent handling Tight turning radius for a big car Trunk is deep and the back seats fold down  easily holding golf bags
1,I leased this car almost a year ago because I could get a great lease deal and liked the styling The engine and transmission are the best features on this car It rides extremely well and has lots of power The problem is in the details The Bluetooth is a joke Our BMW works light years better The navigation system interface was poorly designed It is confusing much harder to use than any other I have tried There has already been one recall plus a loose metal piece that had to replaced in the trunk plus a non working Homelink garage opener plus lack of good steering wheel controls For the same price you could get a BMW that is MUCH better
0,This is a spectacular car its handling is excellent and it grips the road like no other car It is the nicest design interior and exterior in its class Very smooth on the road for the front seats and has been a very reliable car so far I drive a lot it has 16000 miles in less then a year and so far it has not gone for service except for the regular maintenance Great AWD as well drives in the snow beautifully doesnt slip or slide Great job Audi
1,After some very expensive minor repairs and service to our Mercedes E320 My wife and I started researching alternatives We have owned mostly German and Honda cars for many years Except for my jewel like 94 Vett She thought the CTS was too edgy but was totally taken by the STS I was a little skeptical until we took it for a test drive It was really impressive and comfortable The first 1000 mile trip yielded 25 mpg on regular gas Some of the controls are a little unfriendly but well worth the time to master Last night I started the STS from inside a restaurant which turned on the heater   and seat heaters during a snowstorm The warrenty and OnStar are great
0,Excellent car Have had several Audis This is the best even though the others were excellent
1,Purchased a 2007 Avalanche last weekend Traded in my Yukon Denali I have always liked the concept of the Avalanche just could not stand the body cladding I love the 2007 style inside and out Much needed improvement for Chevy I have the LT version with most of the LTZ upgrades 20 inch wheels sunroof rain sensing wipers locking differential etc We will see how the V4 does with the mileage So far on my first tank I am averaging around 12mpg in city
0,This is a very impressive car Love the power in sport mode Build quality is awesome Traded a 2006 A3 20 with DSG I miss the lightning quick paddles and DSG would be a great addition to this vehicle The trunk is huge I have not tested this but I am guessing that I could fit 4 golf bags in it Cant wait to burn up the miles
1,I love My 07 Avalanche Great truck Rides like a Cadillac hauls and tows like a truck Great camping vehicle Great to have lockable bed My only complaint is rear seats are not comfortable on back for a long car trip Been back to the dealer for replacing interior door handle and 2 computer updates Gets much better gas mileage on reg gas vs e85 Dont recommend e85 Runs sluggish and get 1112 mpg vs 1723
0,Since purchase the car presented steering and eletrical problems Audi USA claims the vehicle is operating to specs It drifts left and right Several alignments and hundreds of dollars later I just got used to the way it behaves Electrical problems include warning lights that will not go off Stereo not working MMI malfunction Undercarriage plastic protection ripped off with RAIN WATER Plastic parts wear off too fast The AWD feature is very nice and helps with the handling The interior is very nice Hopefully Audi will master their product eventually I will not be a repeat buyer though Front bumper comes off when parking
1,I purchased this vehicle needing a truck and also an SUV to haul the family around in I havent been disappointed It is extremely comfortable and the design is sharp inside and out The locking truck bed is nice to keep luggage and equipment in when you have passengers up front Im also an XM guy so having it standard on GM vehicles was a big selling point Developed a couple of rattles after about a month  the dealership really wasnt interested in helping to fix them so I eventually found and fixed myself
0,This car does everything well The technology integrated into the vehicle and build quality are superb
1,I have a little over 3000 miles on my LTZ and am really enjoying it It is one of the most comfortable rides I have owned over the years Visibility is excellent although changing lanes on the highway and parking do take a little getting used to with this big beast Definitely splurge on the rear back up camera as I cant imagine parking without it Fit and finish in the LTZ is great and so far in almost 3 months we have not needed to return to the dealership for anything
0,This car is soooo awesome It drives like a dream The luxury amenities are truly luxurious The nav is awesome The capability of calling friends by voice command and bluetooth technology will allow me to never get a ticket It is so beautiful both on the inside and the outside I am having so much fun figuring out how to use the console to its fullest potential
1,We have owned our Avalanche for 1 year and still are glad we bought it Fuel mileage has increased now getting about 2122 mpg if we keep the speed at or below 75 mph The 4 cyl mode started kicking in noticeably more once we passed 15000 miles Some minor squeaks started in the trim but tighentened a couple of screws and they have gone away Only minor problem we have had is with the door handle pulls metal has started to delaminate from the plastic at the edges fixed it with superglue until we can get it into the dealer Its a cross country machine 500 mi on a tank of gas 1000 mi a day with minimal driver fatigue Makes the trip between Reno   and LA a breeze
0,The Audi A6 32 Quattro SLine virtually embodies my vision of what a luxury performance sedan should be Quattro fourwheeldrive provides incredible control handling and steering through curves and around corners SLine suspension gives onrails feeling Averaging 22 mpg while driving it passionately Stunning and comfortable interior with full array of electronics excellent bluetooth Treo 700p worked from the start navigation system small additional display in front of driver allows larger screen to be freed from mapuse which has been deadon accurate wonderful climate system and heated seats bottoms and backs I love looking at it
1,I was looking at 07 Silverado crewcabs I did some research and realized that the new Silverado does not have 4 wheels disc brakes the 00 dida nd a long list of stuff that I wanted XM steering wheel mounted controls 53V8 alloys etc were standard on the Avalanche but optional on the regular pickups Additionally theres no provision on the regular pickup for securing the cargo bed I bought the Avalanche LT1 with Bose and locking differential all the stuff I wanted without a bunch of stuff I couldnt care about The styling is great and the ride is super comfy Gas mileage is about what you would expect for a 5500 lb vehicleabout 1415 in the city 20 21 on the road
0,The first thing that is great about the car is its elegant interior Ive owned BMWs and Lexus and MBZs and they all come in a distant second to the interior The sure footedness of its all wheel drive makes it a fun car to drive yet not stiff and rugged like its german relatives This vehicle is not the quickest off the line but the real world does not live in the 060 realm it is in real driving situations where this car exceeds expectations The MMI took a while to learn but who needs it when you have the voice activated commands
1,Very overrated typical Chevy poor mpg Lots of cab noise Many blind spots instrumentation is poor must take eyes off road for extended periods of time to figure controls out of standard arm reach
0,Fast quiet responsive well appointed bells and whistles aside I love going to work now The mountain freeway I drive to and from work is fun now for the first time in 25 years Its taking me a little time getting used to the differences of driving from my old car and 1995 Jeep where my legs go down in from of me and the steering wheel isnt between my knees The 2007 A6 is a race car It hunkers down into turns asking me to push the gas peddle a little further down as if it wants to go faster The car has a quality that puts it in a class with any other more expensive car on the road Consumer reports for the 2007 Audi A6 will be all good I believe I couldnt be more impressed
1,All other SUVs stand way below the 07 Avalanche I purchased 2 months ago and it now has 6000 miles of trouble free driving I traded an 03 Yukon for it and would never go back This is the best truckSUV I have ever owned I would highly recommend and have to family and friends The styling is dead on and they fixed the cheap interior and exterior finishes of earlier models Look for the LT3 with the 20 wheels option which will save about  dollar3K from the LTZ package with same options
0,I agonized over this car for months Audi vs BMW vs Lexus vs Acura I am defiinitely very happy The V8 is quick off the line but is more appreciated when passing on the freeway S line handling and paddle shifter are fun but not mandatory New addition is the review camera  which becomes important in the city bumpers not made for love taps Interior comfort very similar to the A8 The car is awesome The Nav is easier to use than BMW Decent mpg for a V8 The brakes could be a more responsive Apparently they didnt make too many of the V8 A6s  usually are ordered only  and so you wind up paying more for it just 1k under MSRP but is definitely worth it
1,A shaved down model from previous years Intenseley cheapened Interior noise is excessive Placement of switches inconvenient difficult to actuate because of positioning Guage background in near black with dark sootlike numbers blend into an almost invisible display Great effort to see speed gas remaining and the like This is the poorest of poor Add sun glasses and the display is unreadable The sun lightens the top of the dash which in turn reflects from the inside of the windshield limiting your vision The garage door opener buttons require a copilot to actuate them
0,The Audi A8 Sport is one of the most aesthetically pleasing cars I have ever seen The real surprise however is the combination of ride quiet and predictable handling in all conditions with high limits for a vehicle of this size and class I expected competence but I was surprised by the fun to drive aspects of this car The longer I have owned the vehicle the better it gets I drove the MB Jaguar BMW and Lexus  there was no question before I purchased the car which one I preferred  but I am even more convinced now that I have more than 14000 miles on the vehicle and continue to explore its capabilities I hope Audi doesnt change much before I am ready for my next one
1,I bought the car about three weeks ago Got the LTZ package which is just great with navigation rear entertainment system reverse camera power mirrors and pedals sunroof and 20 rims Hard to find a brush guard for it but other than that its a great car My cousins have an 02 and an 05 but they come nowhere near this baby
0,The A8 never fails to amaze us On a recent vacation we drove 700 miles north and on the way the kids never asked Are we there yet once The car is so relaxing to travel in and makes any journey comfortable The gas mileage is equally impressive on our vacation we averaged 28 mpg and drove most of the way at 80 mph The 350hp direct injection 42L V8 has immediate power and even more refinement The MMI is easy to use and just makes sense We looked at the Lexus LS460 but it felt big heavy and was worse to drive than the old LS430 the Lexus had too many features and had millions of buttons The 2007 BMW 750i had the stupid Idrive and the S550 was too expensive The A8 is brilliant
1,Only problem with my 1st one was the PCV valve which the dealer fixed This new one so far has been great I can hardly feel the transition between 8 cyl to 4 cyl Ill be much happier with the better gas mileage
0,Ive owned a 1979 5000S and a 2002 A4 18T among other makesmodels This car is truly the ultimate driving machine bar none sorry BMW Ive blown away many wannabes in BMWs from 3series up to the 7series on both highway and backroads with this baby and its never misbehaved or thrown me a surprise Incredible power positive steering and an amazing ride
1,I recently purchased the 2007 LT Avalanche and its an awesome truck The interior is that of a luxury car not to mention it drives and rides like a car The turning radius is unbelievable for a vehicle this size The new body style is great Surprisingly has a more aggressive look without the bulky plastic side panels If you need an SUVTruck this is the way to go
0,This car represents the perfect blend between luxury accomodations and sporty performance While other luxury cars S550 BMW750   and lS460seem to be good in some areas and weak in others the A8 is excellent in every single area and weak in none The ride is superb design flawless and the handling is simply amazing extremely nimble for a large car The attention to detail is impeccable everywhere you look and the ergonomics is simply fantastic The interior will put anything south of 200K to shame These days I find myself running more errands I wonder why
1,This is my third Avalanche and at this point cant think of another ride I like better I liked the other two so much that I had this one Customized by Southern Comfort Now its not only a great ride but a real eye catcher
0,My black on black A8L is built like a bank vault is quiet except when accelerating when it has a nice little throaty tone Ive had an A6 27 which was fun still have an A6 42 2002 which is still solid and fun to drive I had a 2006 A8L which was great but the 07 car is even better It is understated sumptuous quick and solid Everything one could want
1,This is my first Avalanche and I cant tell you enough how much I enjoy this vehicle This Avalanche is very fun to drive and has plenty of options to keep you occupied The interior looks great and the seats are comfortable I love the look of the exterior and I still get my neighbors wanting to check it out You cant go wrong with this vehicle
0,I have owned Jags Mercs BMW and Cadillacs and they all have their outstanding features The regal look of the Jag the comfort of the Merc and the Cadis smooth ride The Audi L W12 my first took the best features of luxury automobiles in its class and built a car that has lived up to my expectations Yes the car has a six figure price tag fully loaded however the car delivers on all its promises and gives the driver a senseof royalty without being to flashy Would it be fair to say that I am an Audi man for life YES
1,My friends had an 05 Avalanche and they just loved it We recently went camping with them with it and found that my wife and I loved it as well Then we could not wait for the all new 07 Avalanche to come out We finally got our and we love it even more The ride and handling are much better The build quality both inside and out cannot even be compared with the previous Avalanche GM did their homework Love everything about it
0,This is my third Audi and I find them to be a superb balance between a luxury and sporty design philosophy The vehicle feels like a smaller more nimble vehicle but has more room than practically anything else in this segment The interior design and fit and finish are best in class The S8 variant is an attractive alternative but we also had a sporty car in the garage and decided to go with the long wheel base and the extra rear leg room which precludes the S8 package But I also feel the extra length gives the car a more flowing appearance in the side view Fuel economy is what you expect in this class and when considering the performance and the way I drive it is rather good
1,The Avalanche has come a long way in just a short time The ride is so much smoother Never mind the new look insude and out
0,I looked at all the luxury models in this class this car cant be touched for the money you pay Its all I expected and more
1,Hard to believe it is a truck Rides better than my wifes Denali SUV Sure get poor mileage with E85 though
0,This car drives like a sports car and has the luxury you wish was in other sports cars It has great speed and acceleration and can turn with ease The leather seats are just fantastic for comfort
1,Hadnt even planned to look at Chevy in my quest for a new SUV Drove by a dealer and figured what the heck Ill take a quick look Drove out in a new 2007 Avalanche  Packed with options inside love the 20 factory rims and new body style outside Very quiet and smooth ride Great towing capacity
0,I love this car After driving a Jaguar for 3 years I was able to see the difference with my first test drive This car is wonderful The fit and finish is second to none The drive is terrific and the quality of the leather and wood cannot be matched other then perhaps a Rolls Royce The power is great and the looks equate to understated elegence Every two or three years I purchase or lease a different type of luxury vehicle I truly believe from now on I will always purchase an Audi Its a great car
1,The new style is tops for GM Ive seen the spy photos of the new Silverados and wasnt blown away Didnt really want an Avalanche but found one that had every option but a heated block Dealer made me a fair deal and I jumped on it From my 03 Silverado SS this vehicle glows with class and style
0,The Audi A8L is the perfect vehicle for me I drive about 50k miles per year between North Carolina and northern VADC and it can get very tiring in the wrong kind of car The Audi is fun to drive and is very quiet and comfortable The quattro drive is great when there are some icy conditions on the VA highways The bluetooth connection with my phone works superbly and keeps my attention on the road while driving The rear camera and front and rear parking sensors are very handy when parking and backing out of crowded parking garages The rear seat area is very spacious and will seat 3 The rear leg and shoulder room is unbelievable I can easily fit my 2 biggest clients back there
1,Reliable inc all the way down to  10F no issue Not sporty understeer or sexy but a very functional commuter Inexpensiveeasy to maintain great on gas 35mpg at 80mph BUT at 30 000 was getting bucking cold about 40F outside when slowing at stop signs and bucking when cold at 30mph with flashing check engine light  deayler confirmed valve issue to be fixed under warranty Synthetic oil since I got it didnt save it from this defect Also had belt tensionner issues and rotor vibration turning the rotors fixed that Otherwise I do like the car and the service is friendlytrustworthy they are throwing in a new Timing belt install
0,This car is beautiful inside and out It feels classy rather than flashy We just had a major snowstorm here in Seattle and while everyone else including lots of 4wd SUVs skidded off the road I drove right home
1,I purchased this vehicle brand new as my first car two years ago Since then I replaced four tires brakes battery and now my alternator is gone out And luckily for GM after the bumper to bumper warranty No one can explain to me other then mileage why this car is failing me No harsh driving just work was far and assisting others in the home with their daily routine No help for anything but has overpriced for all services Complaints or concerns are never heard and no offer of extended warranty to help ease the cost From this point I have lost all faith in GM and have decided that I would not buy Chevy ever again GM fix this problem and maybe your problem will be fixed
0,Purchased in Sept 2006 Third Audi Ive bought in past 4 years A6 27T and A6 42 and now this A8L I still have the A6 42 which is 4 yrs old and in top shape with 54000 miles on it No problems The new A8 is rock solid and just as peppy as the A6 Interior is absolutely top quality MMI is a bit daunting for me but I am working through it Never had one before I think the side mirrors could be a bit larger but I love everything else including the massage seats and front and back radar for parking I will buy another in 3 or 4 years
1,Radiator leaks on the 10th month was replaced under warranty On the 25th month at 23ooo miles again the radiator leaks It will no longer be covered with warranty according to the dealer bec I had my vehicle serviced by another autoshop since I relocated What a great headache Avoid this Chevrolet aveo sedan
0,I just picked up my A8L 42 V8 2 weeks ago and it is THE most luxurious car Ive ever owned The attention to detail of the interior leather and wood is sheer perfection The drive is amazingly smooth but as precise as a surgeons scalpel I cant believe that a large luxury car like this handles so well Not to mention the all wheel drive gives me a feeling of confidence on the road that is a true benefit Mine is Black with Amaretto Leather and the B   and O stereo The rear seat room is amazing and my girls love the power rear seats
1,I purchased this car this month in order to get too and from school What a great investment this is my first manual transmission car and BOY is this little thing funIt looks good going down the road and is an overall great car Not to mention this thing will take you 400 miles on a single tank of gas
0,The most beautiful car Ive ever owned Stunningly luxurious interior classy exterior polished demeanor great acceleration from 350hp V8 dazzling 19 wheels that turn heads super attention to detail nimble handling that belies its size and so much more I bought it last week and already took it across the state line
1,Only my 3rd vehicleall Chevy to never have a problem Put 62000 miles in 54 weeks on this car changed tires at 45000 miles Been a surprise as to driving Due to my financial problems sold 3 Mercedes sl55s55cl55 and a 2007 corvette Very surprised the performance and seats did not bother me after coming out of my prior vehicles Was very bad and only changed oil 1 time and never went in for normal service oil level never went down even after long quick trips Gad millage at 85 was 27295 Wind can push this car very easy and had occasionally caused the steering wheel to be knocked out of my hand Breaks squeaked a lot in the morning
0,This car is what luxury cars are all about The interior fitfinish is second to no car on earth The exterior design is flawless even the grille is growing on me The incredible power of the W12 powertrain is nothing short of amazing The ride and handling balance is perhaps best in class I absolutely love it
1,6500 miles  in for repair 4 times 1  bad light relay 2  would not accelerate bad throttle body 3  overheating and no air conditioner told it was low on antifreeze 4  engine is bad Knocked loudly from cam shaft We are still waiting for a short block and head This averages out to less than 2000 miles per repair The dealer has been Nice and Chevy is paying for a rental but what a pain for a new car And we bought a new so we wouldnt have to deal with this sort of thing We are highly disappointed
0,We have had a vastly different experience to many of the recent posts We have had this car for nearly 2 years and have had no defects or problems The engine MMI system tires etc have all been faultless The car is extremely comfortable and surprisingly easy to drive given its size In fact we are considering purchasing another Audi due to our satisfaction Perhaps we just got lucky but this vehicle has been terrific for us Prestigious stylish comfortable and reliable If it got 10mpg more in the city it would be perfect
1,This vehicle is cheap but that says a lot for the quality of the vehicle At 3000 miles the windshield crackedmanufacturer defect At 13000 miles lost all my oil which the oil light never came oncurrently in the shop having the seals and gaskets in the engine replacedmight as well replace the whole engine I bought this car for the gas mileage Averaging about 28 miles per gallon on highway and about 25 with the air conditioner on Not good The car shakes like it needs to be aligned which I did and also had new high quality tires put on and it still shakes terribly I am truly scared to drive this car in high wind and rain Hydroplanes bad
0,I just spent almost  dollar2000 to replace the brakes   and rotors and the tires on my Audi Q7 which is only two years old and has only 18000 miles on it I called the Audi dealership and they said I must drive the car hard They also said they see plenty of Q7s that need brake replacements at 18K Im a middle aged housewifenot a teenage speed racer who slams on the brakes Im more like Driving Miss Daisy After reading many reviews I have found out that many other owners have had to do the same routine maintenance during the course of their leases Unfortunately the  dollar500 maintenance package that I bought when the lease started only covers oil changes Luxury Jiffy Lube
1,I bought this car mainly for the fuel economy This is the only area it reached my expectations I have had it into the dealer 4 times for problems One of them involved replacing the main seal which took a week This is a defect in the vehicle other Aveos have the same problem The car didnt even have 8000 miles on it Then within a week I had to have a sensor replaced In the past I have always been pleased with GM vehicles but this one is a major disappointment I dont feel safe driving it long distances and I am glad there is a dealer near my home and another near my work I will be getting rid of this car ASAP
0,Like many of you I fell in love with the Q7 Ive had it a year heres my issues electrical system went out brains of the car fuel gage failed 3 tire flat tires within 1 year Also had the same problem as someone earlier as a very small amount of liquid spilled next to the drink cups It shorted my system to the tune of  dollar1000 Love the car and hate the car at the same time
1,I really like driving the car so it is a fun car with 6k into it However in severe crosswinds unacceptable howling noise across cowl fuel economy isnt what expected at 25 mpg windshield wipers werent tighten and flopped all over I want GM to have a contender in this class of vehicle  dollar12500 isnt cheap Fix these things and GM will have one on both price and realiablity
0,Well I really felt the need to read everyone elses reviews after bringing my car in to be serviced too many times I got it brand new fresh from Germany and love the way it looks   and the way it rides and of course all the bells   and whistles but too many problems have occured It started with the tire pressure light appearing on all the time which took many 1 hour trips to be serviced only at Audi Then the fuel pump went out took a few days to repair parts only come from Germany you know then a faulty back sunroof that let water in which caused me to drive a Grand Prix for a weekare you kidding me I paid  dollar65000 to drive a Grand Prix Needed new tires already squeeking brakes
1,Got tired of commuting in my SUV getting 20mpg in summer and 18 in winter Bought the Aveo on Edmunds study of lowest vehicle cost per mile We get 31 to 34 in the city commuting and took one trip of 300 miles one way 31 into the wind of 20 mph and 38 coming with the wind Has plenty of power for most needs Havent found anything to complain about Does what it was made to do Economy car shoppers beware of the foreign car hype of high gas mileage we rented several of them before buying and found them to be lacking in mpg from what the manufacturer advertised This is made by Daewoo plant to Chevy specs but at least our money stays in the USA Good job GM
0,Bought the top of the line model fully loaded and a year later it has proven to be a piece of junk Brakes squealing since 5k and Audi is telling us it is normal and acceptable  just due to the design Even gave us a fancy printed brochure justifying the squealing Motor in rear wiper already needed replacement recall on trunk software and MMI mysteriously stops working from time to time Told we will need to replace tires soon despite only having 158k mi on car and have only owned it one year Audi has produced a fine looking car but the quality stops there Do not buy one
1,Being a fulltime student with very little funds I was very limited on which car I could buy I didnt necessarily want the Aveo at first especially after finding out that it was Korean made and had some bad reviews However I have to say that I absolutely enjoy this car I love how I dont have to be right on top of the steering wheel Im 5 foot even The interior is cheapy but really I needed a car to get from A to B with the best gas possible for the less price I found it I couldnt be happier with my choice
0,I bought my Q7 brand new and it is my favorite auto I have ever owned It is responsive in S when you want to feel speed it has the perfect size inside and out not too big and not too small I love the 4 captain chairs and third row just in case we need them As a new mom I love the automatic tailgate and smart key each door unlocking when near without pulling out the key The best of all is its sexy lines It doesnt get better than this
1,I was very impressed with the ride comfort an handling of this car It is a vast improvement over subcompacts of previous generations I really like the european stlying direction GM has been taking with the vehicles it has brought to market over the last few years It is a little strained to accelerate up a hill starting from a standstill but what the hell its no worse than our Jeep Liberty The shift quality could be a little better but here again I didnt purchase a Porsche To sum up in terms of interior and exterior styling fuel economy ride comfort and handling it is a very good value for the money I made my purchase chioce over Honda Fit Toyota Yaris
0,My Audi Q7 has been the nicest drive for handling comfort and acceleration but the electronics have failed since about 3 weeks after I brought it home When it doesnt work it doesnt work no GPS phoneradio CD iPod nothing And this was at the same time the steering column got stuck in the down position While setting my preferred settings I lowered it it stayed there for a month or so the service dept fixed it but the rest is a on going mystery
1,The interior is solid performance is good However the steering wheel and drivers seat vibrate excessively when idling the gas mileage is under 20mpg when using the ac the struts squeak when going over bumps and the ride is very stiff you feel every bump
0,After buying a Acura MDX a year ago I traded it for a Q7 Huge upgrade And basically the same price no comparison This was the buying decision I should have made but at the time I was a new SUV driver and the Q7 seemed like a lot of vehicle for me then I love the Q7 from the interior and exterior foot lights to the powerful but smooth styling Build quality is exceptional superb braking and transmission makes for a very safe and smooth ride
1,Overall driving experience witht this car has been good A little slow on pick up when going up inclines but other than that I have no complaints
0,I love to drive my Audi Q7 It handles like a dream on the highway The Quattro AWD is the best I have driven for the size of vehicle the handling is nimble
1,Very light weight handles very poorly in wind Gets a nasty screeching noise from doors or mirrors when driving in wind Front engine crankshaft seal failed yesterday lost all oil damaged engine oilidiot light did not come on before engine started knocking GM will only replace damaged parts which is the crankshaft and bearings Not pleased with that should get a fresh engine and waranty Manual transmission is already showing signs of problems clunks into gear and sometimes hard to get into first I am not a kid hot roding it Its a commuter car I drive it carefully
0,I love the SUV Audi has done it again The car is a pleasure to drive The only problem I had is the air compressor was defective and I could not fill my tire with air when I needed to
1,Very fun to drive although not a cold weather car by any means If you live somewhere that it is below freezing a lot do not buy this car The defrost outside of the main vents isnt very good and it will drive you crazy Ive no complaints on this car yet make sure you get auto door locks as its optional I do not have them and wish Id gone for it Get all options on this car as there are not many  and it still will not cost you that much
0,Ive been driving mine for about 6 months now and I do love it Its a lot like driving a loaded A6 my Q7 is a 42 premium It handles well accelerates well and is extremely comfortable to drive The tech bells and whistles offer everything you could need and want My only complaint with the car is the offroad abilities Thule doesnt make racks for it and for anyone who is an outdoor enthusiant looking for a more rugged vehicle worthy of hauling bikes kayaks etc you may find yourself a little disappointed However some research early on may prove that this is the perfect all around vehicle for you My wife has a Lexus and ive gone through Land Rovers BMW X5 Tahoe etc
1,I would have to say without a doubt that the improvments in styling for the 2007 model sold us but I especially liked the new rear tailight design It is much bigger inside than it looks although rear space is limited but feels like a much more expensive car than it is The ride is good for a small car and handling is also good and makes for easy parking
0,The Audi Q7 36 Premium is a beautiful car I get many people peeking through the windows trying to see the wonderful interior I also get many compliments on how it looks everytime I go gas it or go to school I got the Q7 after I traded in my Navigator I hated how the Navigator drove and looked compared to Q7 The Q7 makes other SUVs look like boxes on wheels The Q7 drives very easy in tight spaces making it feel smaller than it really is People may think that the MMI will be hard to operate but its not All the rows have comfortable seats but the third row is hard to get to The ride is much smoother than the Navigator and goes over rough surfaces very nicely
1,I like my new Aveo but the gas mileage is not what I expected or was reported I think it should have a switch where you can lock doors from inside
0,Purchased 36 premium I love this car Handles and performs like a sports sedan even though this is a big SUV Fun to drive
1,When looking for an economy car that primarily would be used for workcommuting I looked for in this order reliablitydependability gas mileage price and optionslooks Amoung others looked at Ford Focus Saturn ION and the economy one from Toyota which I cant remember the name of but not much to be disired either After test driving and having the vehicle I have which is the Chevy Aveo I am happy with its performance maintenance options price and gas mileage and I like how it handles curves I feel safe and comfortable Even though its slow going up hill at the rate of speed I prefer but its keeping my gas mileage reasonable Overall I dont regret purchasing it
0,This is by far the best SUV on the planet save perhaps the VW Toureg which is made at the same factory as the Q7 The Q7 is much larger than the Toureg The quality and ride are just outstanding and in line with the Audi reliability for building world class vehicles The interior fit and finish are first class and if you fold down the third row you have incredible storage space Of course if you fold down the second row also the storage space is huge As far as safety goes the Q7 comes with all the stateoftheart safety features This is in line with the safety committments from both Volkswagen and Audi both of whom are always in the forefront of automotive safety
1,This is a good little car but I wouldnt buy one unless your in it for the long haul If you want something thats good on gas fun to drive and cheap the Cobalt is a good choice but I wouldnt buy a GM product unless I planned on keeping it for 10 years Its poor resale value overwhelms the cost of paying it off Overall its a well built car but the plastic interior is a bit cheap Also dont slam the glove box or it will crack at the opener like mine did
0,Got a rare SLine version with factory 21 wheels that are polished on the face and painted grey on the inside Car looks very menacing all in lava grey Handles very well although not quite as quick as our dearly departed Audi allroad 27T But torque is phenomenal SLine 3point steering wheel mounted shift paddles allow for even smoother gear changes than those possible on my DSG equipped Audi TT 32Q
1,I love my Cobalt but I am worried about its reliability My visor broke after I had the car about a year I have not even had the car 2 years and the top part of my shifter knob just broke off along with the plugs for the chargers no longer working Also the emergency break went out Great that its still under warranty but what am I going to do after that
0,I think this is the most well built and value packed SUV on the market today Ive looked at many others such as the ML500 X5 46 Range Rover Sport and GL450  none of them compared in my opinion Dont get me wrong they all have their strengths but overall I felt the Audi Q7 was the best fit For the money what you get in the Q7 is an exceptional value I have enjoyed the drive and find it hard not to drive I also have a Lincoln Navigator and an Audi A8L  the A8L used to be on the top of my list to drive but this Q7 edges it out ever so slightly The Navigator was nice but it lacks that European road feel
1,Not sure where to starthad my Cobalt for less than a month when I heard a horrible rattling noise Took it to the dealership only to find that the windshield had been installed upside down and had to be replaced Got the car out of the shop Drove it for two weeks and started hearing a horrible noise in the front end Two compressors later and I still hear a bug zapper like sound when I run the heat or the air Dealership swears that they cant hear it but everyone else who has ever been in the car has commented on it The car drives okay but honestly has been in the shop way to often for a brand new vehicle As the owner of both an 07 Cobalt and an 07 Malibu LS Im unhappy wGM
0,Great build quality this is a really solid vehicle from the heavy feel of the doors to the look and feel of the interior This is my 4th Audi in a row but first SUV so I really looked at all the options I think the Audi offers more class refinement and style than the rest of the crowd without any serious flaws If you are not a snob but insist on German engineering and styling the Q7 comes highly recommended
1,What can I say Its a great car that GM has finally put some real effort into For me its been 1 month since I took delivery and there hasnt been a day I didnt look forward to driving it Moreover driving it daily has been a great experience The fuel economy when not heavy footed hardly ever due to the rewarding power of the Eaton M62 Supercharger is comparable to that of the ultracompact econogas misers Yaris Aveo etc The factory performence packages being offered by GMs Performence Parts division are the best to be found in the aftermarket So you get more power out of your beast while retaining full factory warranty when installed co GM Service depts hard to argue
0,My family has owned Audis ever since I can remember There has always been at least one in the family when I was growing up The second car was an assortment over the years and the Audis always outperformed them I had to get the Q7 after trading in my A6 Acceleration and fuel economy is pretty good considering the vehicles size and weight The interior is impeccable Everything fits together and the materials are high quality The three panel sunroof is a definite plus and even though it is tight the third row can be handy Dont use it on a regular basis but when Im in a pinch it works out fine With the third row folded the trunk is extremely spacious the power liftgate helps a lot
1,I bought this car brand new The first week it was fine But within the second and third week of driving strange noises started coming from the front engine area  these weird ratting sounds that would come and go And after 3 weeks a horribly loud noise suddenly started clicking It sounded like it was coming from the right front tire So I had to take it back to the dealership to get fixed The brakes also make a strained sound and they arent paticularly as sharp as Id like them to be The clanking sound is unnerving and extremley annoying Now I have to go out of my way to get it fixed This is inconvienent and not fair  Ive only owned for less than a month
0,I was previously driving a Mercedes R350 before the Q7 was out and when it came out I knew I had to drive it on looks alone Im a 27 year old father and when I had to drive the R350 I didnt enjoy it because it looked like a minivan and it wasnt fun to drive The Q7 was so much more masculine looking it drove better sat more people and most of all it wasnt a minivan
1,After looking at Honda and Mazda etc when shopping for my next ride none had the optionsprice I was looking for without buying aftermarket items On long drives I do not suffer from fatigue I felt in previous cars or feel in other models that I get from the rental companies My job requires extensive travel and I find myself comparing every rental I receive to my Cobalt The Cobalt handles very well I get a good sense of the road when behind the wheel Simply put my Cobalt is not going anywhere unless I am driving
0,I am thrilled with this car Fun to drive comfortable for 6 adults able to tow 6500 lbs and unique among a sea of lookalikes The 36 performs very well with an assertive growl and silky smooth acceleration Punch it and it will GO
1,I have not owned a GM in a while I must say for the price and for a 4 cylinder car the performance is great Handling is sharp has every feature in most dealer models the heated leather seats are great I compared this model to a new Civic and a new Focus this had more options and is faster for about the same amount Although I have not had it that long the build quality seems very good Another thing to point out its made in America My fiance also recently bought a Pontiac G6 and is also very good I would say one of the best cars they have built in a long time GM is making some good changes thier new lineup is more reliable appeals to the market and still costs less
0,Ive had Audis for years and have always felt secure driving them I live in a four season climate and have driven in snow and ice storms This Audi feels very strong to drive and very safe The Quattro system is the best four wheel drive system of any make of automobile in my opinion
1,I really enjoy my Cobalt so far but have only owned it for 1 week and havent had a chance to take it on a long trip I have only been getting around 20 miles per gallon in town which is a big disappointment to me because I was told this vehicle would get around 25 miles per gallon for in town driving
0,Ive own many different SUVs over the past 12 years from two Fords Exp Subaru B9 Jeeps and even my wifes KIA which was a mistake The Q7 36 premium is fun to drive responsive but still a SUV weight I drove the BMW Mercedes and Volvo before I decided on the Q7 The Q7 handles like a heavy sport car as you fill the road a little too much with the 20 inch wheels The fit and finish is exceptional A great buy and really fun to drive Watch your speed as you may not notice how fast you are going Options can make the car a little pricey But you pay for what you get
1,For the money the power build and fuel economy it is just as good if not better than any import Kudos to GM for this vehicle And as a former Honda BMW Mercedes owner Im not just saying that GM is again an entry level leader
0,My first Audi and I must say I am very impressed Now considering adding an S6 or maybe the new S5 to my stable Driving this 42 SLine makes me feel like a very lucky guy
1,The LS build was certainly a fun car to drive Obviously its not a sport so performance is not its focus The LS is built tight with pretty good suspension Despite the size of the engine acceleration was adequate The interior is clean and easy to follow with no confusion among the cluster gauges The only thing I regret when I owned the car was that I opted for the basic model Id strongly recommend upgrading to a higher model with automatic features because it certainly improves the convenience The fact that ABS is not standard is disconcerting Ive not owned it a long time so the Chevrolet rapport is disconcerting Not too sure if this car will last like a Toyota
0,I have owned about 26 cars in my life and several Audis but this is by far the most complete package fun to drive comfortable well made vehicle I ever owned It is a true pleasure to drive and it is beautiful inside and out Everything is well thought as always on Audis This the best SUV in this class hands down
1,The 2007 Cobalt LS 2 door in some ways is a stylish car but from looking at the front and sides looks too much like a revamped Cavalier I expected more from this car than it delivered Gas mileage on the 22 automatic is terrible for a 4 cylinder eats far more gas than a Nissan Altima 25 4 banger and isnt half as fast in fact its sluggish by comparrison Comfort is basic behind the times needs better standard sound system w larger standard sized tires wheels Vehicle is noisy inside passenger cabin and exterior paint job inferior marks chips easily Many blind spots when parking observing on coming traffic from behind and passing Its a revamped Cavalier
0,I replaced my 6th GMC YukonDenali with this SLine Q7 and could not be happier The Q7s build quality is absolutely outstanding and the features are awesome Vehicle is rock solid on freeway and handles like a much smaller and lighter vehicle Exhaust note is really fun My other car for summer is a BMW 645 CiC Im averaging 15 mpg over 4000 miles I can just begin to feel the engine opening up
1,Well to sum it up in one word the word nightmare comes to mind The car is actually very nice to drive handles better than my Mustang ever did and it has just enough pep to get me into trouble However let me tell you the bad about it There is this rather loud annoying rattle which can not be figured out by two different dealerships Had it in five times parts replaced every time and still nothing Also it has this little issue that makes it not start at the most of inconvenient of times No one can figure that one out either I will tell you that to me this car is the biggest waste of money and GM integrity that I have ever encountered GM Build a better Cobalt
0,Just leased an Audi Q7 42 Added dvd nav sunroof technology pkg etc The Q7 is not only a fun drive but secondly also extremely useful in hauling people and stuff comfortably No problem in terms of accelerating up hills or moving getting around slower vehicles Interior is one of the finest I have been in with everything laid out nicely and easily reached The MMI takes a little bit of getting use to but now I have no problems Fuel mileage isnt great 13 mpg so far but I doubt anyonewho bought this vehicle is worried about the cost of filling the tank
1,I now have over 10500 mi on the car and its still without any problems I took the car to the shop 3 times Once for an oil change and 2 because of something I did Bent a rim and hit a deer I abuse this car and it still treats me great Im now getting 3037MPG depending on how I drive The front tires are now starting to show noticeable wear My only big gripe with the car is the noisy wheel covers They squeak and rattle over bumps and it makes the car seem like less quality than it actually is Next time Im getting alloys I still get compliments on the looks Why are people still buying imports Chevy packs quality value dependability and fun all in one car Check this one out
0,Nothing really to gripe about Excellent ride real tight no rattles Plenty power and torque All the bells and whistles I like it The styling is growing on me
1,I bought this car the day after Christmas 06 Didnt have it a month and Air conditioner coil busted March the fan troud begins rattling AC compressor squeaks and random not starting I took it to the dealer tightened the fan troud replaced the Ac compressor and couldnt find anything wrong why it wont start June 08 gear shifter assembly fell apart GM didnt cover it 32186 A year later out of warranty these things are still occurring with the same response These cars are pieces of junk Something always needing to be repaired
0,I am amazed at how well car seats fit in the 2nd and 3rd row This car has been great for my family The day after we purchased this car it snowed a lot This SUV handles better in the snow than our other 2 cars being a Toyota Tundra limited 4x4 and a Jeep Grand Cherokee limited alltime 4wheel drive The seats are comfortable with different adjustable heat levels Perfect for a family where one person is hot and the other cold we each have our own temp controls An amazing car Lots of room and it looks nice too My only complaint is having a cell phone charger plugged in is slightly awkward It drives like a car and suv combined I am so impressed
1,Purchased this vehicle used had looked up car fax info and researched mileage Guess what Im only getting 19 mpg in the city its a good thing I only work 5 miles away The car has a nice build and I cant find anything else I dont like about the car Im just disappointed in its performance Ive had other used vehicles with a V8 that gave me 22 mpg in the city Ive taken it back to be serviced and Im told theres nothing wrong it must be my driving habits Ive only put about 500 miles on this vehicle
0,I had a loaded 27 twin turbo allroad for four years I started tracking the Pikes Peak concept with great anticipation I ordered my 42 Premium Sline with all the options Loved the allroad but the Q7 tops it on all accounts Exhaust note is powerful when revving it up yet quiet when featherfooting it MMI is not as difficult as people think it is The voice driven system works great and is very accurate The adaptive suspension goes from low and sporty up to tall and beefy The sound system is impressive and easily fine tuned Gotta love a sun roof Especially one that is over 5 feet long and 39 inches wide When the motorized screen retracts oohs and aahs are common
1,Ive had the car for a little over a year and I think that it is a good car for having over 16000 miles already There are some improvements that need to be made though It has great fuel economy at 30 mpg and that is not highway Comfortable seating in front but not the back good stereo system Car is fun to drive on winding roads The car has been in the shop twice Once for bad control arm bushings and warped rotors And the next for a loud grinding sound in the brakes I think that it needs a 6 disc cd changer Overall it is a good car for a low price
0,I have had my Q for about two weeks I traded an FX45 for it which I loved I wanted something larger but sexy alluring but professional Audi really did it I am not saying I am not going to do a few mods larger tires and rims is all but it really is a beauty all on its own I looked at the MDX VW another FX Range Rover Sport BMW and Mercedes I have never felt so much safer and hotter at the same time A lot of room for my single self and traveling companions Would make a nice soccer mom look FABULOUS All the other mommies will be jealous There is so much room
1,I bought this car new Its only been a year and I want to get rid of it Ive had problems with the transmission wiring the stereo system The passenger airbag said off when I had an adult sitting in the passenger seat There are strange noises and it goes back in the shop tomorrow because its making a jerking motion when Im accelerating at a consistent pace and shaking when I take my foot off the brake Ive already had this car in the shop for 6 things now itll be 7 and its been in the shop for 21 days already not to mention how long it will have to be in this time I think I would have been better off getting used Not worth the money GM really disappointed me with this one
0,After 6 years driving a Lincoln Navigator the Q7 was a wonderful change It handles like a sports car seats are very comfortable engine and ride are extremely quiet and smooth luxury features such as MMI bluetooth rear camera air suspension system large sunroof and sunscreen and rear hatch are very useful and the electronic stability system really works  I felt very safe descending a steep winding icy road without having to use the brakes While the purchase price is high I feel it is worth it I actually look for reasons to drive this car My gas mileage is a bit better than estimated 215highway 16 city I have received many compliments on this car
1,Well I bought the car as cheap as possible to lower the cost and regret it I wish I had power locks and windows but thats my fault for the money its a good car Its horrible in the snow worse even than my 91 Camaro with the 5L v8 Its really pathetic that this car gets stuck as much as it does Its comfortable tho Ill give it that with a lot of room and a big trunk just stay away if it snows in your area unless you want to buy snow tires shouldnt be nessisary on a car like this was never needed on my Camaro If I could do it again Id get the 1lt and get the features most otther cars come standard with
0,I always expect great cars from Audi But this was the best surprise It is a fantastic ride The comfort handling and power from a 6 cyl is outstanding This is the best vehicle in its class
1,I purchased a base model Cobalt LS 4 door sedan as a commuter car to go from home to work I have the automatic transmission upgraded radio and the side curtain airbags and ABS as primary options I chose the Cobalt in part because a relative visited me and rented a new LT model that I drove a few times I was quite impressed by the car The Cobalt is extremely comfortable for me Im 61 and the seating and drivng position is idea Plus after sitting in the car for a few hours on bad traffic days Im not sore or uncomfortable The car handles very competently and has good pep for a small 22L four cylinder The car was very inexpensive to buy
0,I have had my Q7 for about a month now and I love driving this SUV I got the showroom model so it comes with 20 wheels and alloy rims The AC controls are a bit difficult to figure out at first but once you get the hang of it you will find its usefulness We have rear climate control the Bose sound system power tailgate Bluetooth 3rd row seating and of course the MMI navi among few of the features
1,One of the last 07s on the lot Paid  dollar10300 The only option is the auto tranny I only had it a couple days so this is an intitial review The motor has almost the same pep as my 01 Z24 and gets better mileage Im averaging 256 MPG The interior design of the car is a little plain but straight forward and worlds nicer than the Cavalier The electric steering feels a little wierd at first but you get used to it The rear end looks better on the coupe than sedan The DIC does provide some useful stuff and the auto headlights mean you dont have to worry about leaving them on and draining the battery The low beams are as bright as the highs on my Z24 Ill put in another review later
0,We ordered our Sline Q7 in August well worth the wait The driving experience is everything we expected and more The motor sounds authoritative and has plenty of power Seating is comfortable with plenty of head room for the tall ones Third row seat is designated for small passengers on short trips Once we became familiar with the MMI and other options they were very user friendly and worth the time to learn We live in a warm climate and had solar tint installed on the sunroof which helps with reflective heat Learned the battery is under the drivers seat and will need to take to dealer to get battery replaced Why Bummer Overall great ride and meets our expectations on all fronts
1,This has been a great car I have put 26000 miles on it all trouble free Went to the dealer one time for warranty work just a stuck ecv valve total time at the dealership was less than 12 hour Gas mileage is great better than the EPA estimates It would be hard to find a better car for the money While the Cobalt is the replacement for the Cavalier the Cobalt has nothing in common with its predecessor Everything about the Cobalt is leaps and bounds above the Cavalier
0,I bought many SUVs The Q7 is the best SUV I have driven so far Great to drive so comfortable It is a hybrid of a luxury sedan and an SUV Even my kids love the comfort of the back seats Great choice for a family
1,The Cobalt sssc was a great idea but GM blew the execution With less than 20000 miles on the odometer the car is on its third clutch had an injector fail the radio replaced exhaust rattle repaired dash cluster replaced rear seat hinge fixed rear package tray reattached and the best part is GM wont back there product The clutches were reworked due to a manufacturing issue GM claims they have addressed the wear issues but wants consumers to pay around  dollar160000 to replace the part with the new one I know that there is the real possibility I have bought a lemon but GM hasnt stood by there product I would love to know the power of this car but cant Im afraid it will fall apart
0,Waited two months for it to arrive but it was worth every minute I agree with most of the other reviews here The handling is what I am most impressed with Just does not FEEL like I am driving a large SUV Steering is precise around residential streets and around the clover leafs at speed Took my parents out last night My Mom kept saying this is so nice My Dad kept saying I cant get over how smooth the acceleration feels They are both long term SuburbanYukon owners Highway mileage about 21 City about 14 Not great but I knew what I was getting After a month and a half and 2000 miles of driving I have yet to see another one on the road I just love that
1,Well first things first I love my Cobalt SS The power is there when you need it design and interior layout fit the car nicely Only downfall I dislike about this car is the spoiler which is going to be removed when I have some extra cash Also I had a porous head which had to be replaced by the dealership but other than that the car runs and performs great Good buy in my opinion and not too bad for gas mileage currently getting 294 mpg when I dont get on the gas
0,The Q7 has met my hyped up expectations Its a solid ride with premium features you expect from Audi It has a very thoughtful design down to the coming and going external and internal lighting features Its also easy to see the road in the Q7 unlike some other large SUVs
1,I bought this car in January of 07 so far no complaints at all besides I cant seem to stay out of it Chevy offers the stage kits that really make the car come alive Styling is sharp an altogether great sport compact for anyone in the market
0,So far I am REALLY happy This carSUV is fun and sporty but drives like a luxury sedan The engine growls but not too loud I drove the 42 not much more money than a loaded 36 and felt the 36 was faster not sure why maybe less weight Better gas mileage too I also drove the Sline it felt a bit doggie maybe the suspension or tires I love the look and feel of the interior and all the bells and whistles especially the keyless entry no more digging in my purse The MMI takes some getting use to but well worth the time The only thing I did not like at first was the berber carpet so I ordered the all weather mats this made the car look great now I like the durable berber
1,I reluctantly rented this car for a 1500 mile road trip through 4 mountainous states becuase it was the only car left with GPS navigation I was not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised The car is cheap and in many ways cheaply built however GM put the quality into this car where it counts The seats are comfortable but lacking in adjustments This is one of the first automatic transmissions that I dont have to outthink to get the car to do what I want it to do After driving 1500 miles to several national parks I can say that this was one of the most comfortable road trip cars I have ever driven
0,All I can say that the car looks good inside and out But unfortunately I had the car less than two weeks and 500 miles car check engine light came on and the car started to choke and transmission started to stall and oil light came on and its been in the shop for 5 days already and the good part is that they dont have a clue what is going on with the car
1,Agree need to pull interior door handles closer so as not a far reach My biggest trouble is the seat dash and steering With long legs you move the seat back but since the steering wheel doesnt scope youre reaching The steering wheel for tall people cuts out part of the speedometer located on the left and no matter how I adjust the seat and steering its just not comfortable I wish it had more head room also and a little more pickup like my previous small car Im really just not happy at all with it and I really regret buying it The trunk could use a larger opening
0,Perfect handling  feels like a sports car 060 in just 7s Car itself doesnt feel like a big car First when I saw it I thought  oh my God it is too big but after test drive I fell in love with it
1,Great car for the money Designers at GM finally understand what the GenXers want in a car and for the most part have delivered My only tiny gripe is rear visibility as the trunk lid is higher than what Im used to
0,This is one of the best SUVs I have ever driven During my first test drive I didnt know what to expect but I was shocked Very comfortable great handling nice power V8 and full of features You will not be disappointed
1,I love my Cobalt SSSC I just wish I could have gotten the gunmetal rims I dont think its as fast as most like to boast but I have driven some very fast cars before this one The styling is nice inside and out Its a little difficult to get comfortable in the seats you just cant seem to get just the right height and such Im 59 and still cant seem to get comfortable The back window is next to useless because its so small and the wing creates a blind spot even with the lower profile wing that I got Handles very nice Gas mileage could be better but what else would you expect from a supercharger
0,Had to wait 4 months to get this because of the 6 seat configuration and the mfg of the 36s but it was well worth the wait After owning 2 large SUVs AWD Escalade   and 4WD Navigator neither one can hold a candle to this vehicle This vehicle handles more like a sports car but on a much larger scale It will get up and go and the brakes will bring you down in a hurry not to mention a super smooth ride Adaptive air suspension really makes a difference as well The interior is very sporty but also luxurious The premium leather is definite quality There is nothing about this vehicle that is not first class and I am more than happy with my purchase The only downfall was the wait time
1,Gas mileage is terrible I get eleven MPG in town The high back seat makes it near impossible to look out the back window to back up Power seems to be sufficient and electronic traction control is great With this gas mileage I would not recommend buying one
0,I never thought to own an SUV unitl we had a child and we test drove this car Wow it feels a lot like my BMW sedan yet has room like an SUV
1,Bought the truck to haul a lightweight trailer in the summer and get around town in the cold winter months So far no problems truck hauls well drove to Texas last winter with 50 below weather with no problem Gas mileage better than the van we had before  cruising at 110Km we get 32 miles to the gallon Installed a cap on the back to keep items dry
0,Just got a fully loaded Q7 Drives very smoothly Engine sounds great in sports mode Super comfortable and beautiful interior If youre into technology  the MMI is great
1,I started driving this truck in 208 it is my company vehicle It has as much leg room as my 07 Tundra Double Cab and rides just as good It did way better in WI winter conditions than I expected I regularly get 25 mpg on the highway with an aluminum cap and 300  500 lbs of tools and stuff in the back It doesnt have many options but it hasnt had a single mechanical flaw I put 100  220 miles on it daily and I find the seat in my cheapee model comfortable Seems to be a little more cabin noise than I would like but it is so much more comfortable and roomy than S10s This is a standard cab with the 4 banger People flash their brights at me a lot at night when mine arent on
0,Got the Q7 about 3 months ago and love it since Before I was driving the FX35 which was a bit quicker but you cant really compare the quality and features that come with the Audi As a surfer I manage to fit a 96 longboard inside the car together with my wife and two kids A great buy with cool looks
1,Bought truck new Has been fine other than the lousy fuel economy 260 miles or less per tank of fuel on the highway so I am not sure how you others are getting such good mileage Have had the Reduced Power  Check Engine warning light come on 3 times in the last month First time they said it was a bad battery cell the second time they asked me if it had been jumped off to which I answered no Now I wonder what they will blame it on It is under warranty thank God and either it will be fixed or else I am not happy right now and would not recommend the truck to any buyer I had a 98 Ford Ranger that never gave me a problem And Chevy is wondering why they are hurting Duh
0,Well so far the Q7 has met my expectations The handling is smooth precise and powerful Found out that my Q7 has no air conditioner for the two seats in the very back when my two nephews sat there last weekend Bummer On our trip to Santa Barbara on Saturday the temperature was well over 90 and the sunshade covering the panorama sun roof was doing little to keep the sun and heat out My head was baking Why not a solid sun roof cover to keep the sun and heat out Went to a window tinting place in Van Nuys CA to have the entire sunroof and the little sun roof at the very back tinted with a new film that has ceramic in it Cuts the heat but not dark Seems effective so far
1,I adore this truck Its my first Ive wanted one for years Its comfortable I love the look the mileage is good Just didnt expect to have it in the shop 6 times in the year Ive had it Starting issues noisy brakes injector issues and computer software issues with no fix Thank God for my warranty Gets a little sluggish on towing but I only own the base model So it didnt surprise me to have to baby the brakes when I have a 950 lb load in the bed Its rates to tow approx 4k lbs but I wouldnt pull more than 1k with what Ive got
0,Handles like a sports car or at least better than my previous Infiniti FX and the FX is SMALLER Brakes are powerful Luxury features are everywhere Engine sounds sweet and its powerful MMI system is very logical and easy to use I cant wait to take it skiing
1,At less than 10000 miles reduced power and check engine light kept coming on about every two or three weeks I called the dealership and waqs told that I would have to drive it in with thr reduced power on for them to find the problem As I write this the truck is under the garage and will not start Put in new battery and stil nothing Will call dealership tomorrow and have it towed to the shop Very disappointed in a truck thats only a year old Never know what going to go wrong next
0,I bought my Audi Q7 to replace my Honda Pilot I needed the extra towing capacity and I wanted a luxury SUV The Audi Q7 did not disappoint me The inside is typical Audi comfortable quite and well thoughout The controls are all first rate and the cars performance and handling are top notch The mileage is averaging about 163 mpg in mixed driving If you select the sport mode on the transmission it makes a huge performance difference but it does hurt your mileage All in all probably the best SUV on the market today
1,Have had this model for one year There have not been any problems thus far and to myself it is an improvement over the S10There are gas issuesto wit using 87 octane will cause the engine to be stubborn or bucking as such Using 89 octane takes care of that But the tires are something else The are Generals made in Mexico and they are absolute junk I would think that Chevy Division would do something about this No use in going the warranty route since the replacements will be of the same junk Three of the four tires have bumps on them Lastly the handbrake release needs to be better engineered since at times I have to pull pull and pull on the brake release handle
0,I just got the car a few days ago and it was worth the wait Having three kids and looking for a luxury and sporty SUV with room for friends is challenging Audi did it Not only is the handling fantastic but with the air suspension upgrade the ride is so smooth The features for the driver and the passngers are fabulous Although the third row is too small for an adult its perfect for kids Having the sun roof in the rear doesnt make you feel confined as in other 3rd row mid size SUVs
1,well this is about mom and dad age 74 76mom had a few little problems like acid rain drops that wouldnt come off and she on one of her times in there to shop said something about the 5 speed not wanting to go into reversethe reply was 2 peaces of paper that saidA customer can expect a blocked reverse shift 10 in 50 attempts1 in 5Engineering has determined that this condition is a inherit characteristic0607 and should be considered NORMAL they give a procedure for getting it into reverse1shift into 1st gear 2move vehicle forward 3stop and shift to reverseso that means you need to go into traffic to get it to reverse WRONG well i drive a stick and it colorado doesnt work
0,I am not an SUV guy I was looking at an A6 or even an A8 This was responsive and more fun to drive I made my commute less stressful I do have some guilt about the mileage after driving an A4 but the visibility sitting up higher made up for that and the handling kept has all you expect in German Sportiness
1,I have 2500 miles on the truck Taken two trips totaling 800 miles getting about 25 mpg on highway and 1820 normal driving Pulls 3000 pound boat ok Seems kind of small from the Z71 ext cab I bought new in 04 but traded for gas mileage and it is doing better than the 1415 the Z got If getting the 4cyl go with the 5 speed if you plan to do any pulling It will run highway speed with a load in 4th without much trouble but 5th is useless with a trailer As far as driving empty it has plenty of power havent had to take it past 5000 rpm yet when pulling or passing Mine has the 373 gear ratio I think this is the best ratio as it would be turning a lot or rpms in 4th with the 410
0,I road tripped the vehicle from Naples to New Smyrna Beach 250 miles each way the day after I bought it It was far and away the best driving SUV Ive driven to date and Id dare say it was just about comparable to my 7 series I only wish it had keyless startentry
1,i dont know what some reviewers of this truck were driving but it wasnt the same as mine its a great truck with plenty of power and a great ridecannot find a thing to complain about would definately recomend to anyone
0,The Audi Q7 42 is a drivers car It feels just like an Audi sedan The power is impressive as well as the fit and finish Dont expect too much in the way of mileage but with an SUV what do you expect The car is heavy but feels really light and nimble Its exceeded all my expectations
1,Since having the recall on the brake switch done Ive have nothing but problems with my brakes locking up ABS Faults and the dealship says its not covered after 10k miles and that the recall did not cause it and to fix would cost over  dollar1500 The fuel mileage is nowhere near what they say it is Hwy 2224 Im lucky if i get 15 16 and I only get 1012 city Thinking about trading in for a better vehicle
0,Quattrothe most trustable all wheel drive system 350 hp with 325 torque gives an amazing performance Most important driving this big SUV feels like driving a sedan not a truck at all I love the interior fit and finish high quality materials with real wood and stainless steel and the exterior design is bold and elegant I dont think there is anything better out there
1,Now that I haved driven this truck for 6 months I wanted to update my initial review of 92406 Most of the rough idle and cranking problems were solved with a software update to the onboard computer module Soon after I had to take it back for a defective ignition switch Engine would die suddenly while you were driving along Since that first month I have had no problems whatsoever with the vehicle I will say that this is the first vehicle that I have ever gotten so many questionnaires about5 so farI think Most included a new one dollar bill Evidently a lot of people are interested in all aspects of this truckOverallI like this truck a lot better now than I did before
0,Great car It really is a great package sports car performance with room for 5 Though the rear seats are tight there fine for my 3 younger children Great performace engine brakes handling does all very well I like the 08 M3 coupe but it only seats 4 and the 08 M3 sedan looks too much like a plain 3 series Audi hit a bulls eye with styling for a 4 door car Bulging wheel flares remind me of a mid 1980s 911 Turbo Audi builds a great car and the RS4 is a total package of performance quality and style
1,I choose this truck because the price was right however I definitely got what I paid for 4000 miles on it and Ive had it serviced 6 times already Doors wont close properly when its cold door strikers had to be replaced Box rattled and needed parts 4wheel drive broke and needed to be fixed wind noise from doors to name a few problems Luckily it was all warranteed Wont buy GM again
0,It is difficult to find any fault with this extremely well engineered car Its DRC offers a very compliant ride when desired but stiffens in the corners for confident handling in aggressive mode The engine is superb and an aftermarket exhaust system several are available actually makes meaningfully more power Its redline is 8250 rpm and it is a joy to drive with smoothly delivered power across the rpm range Winter handling with winter tires is exceptional and the car is on rails in hard packed snow The design is distinctive even compared to current model A4s Perhaps the only thing that I would change is the seat height which does not lower sufficiently for me I am 6
1,I traded in a 2004 Toyota Tacoma for this 2007 Colorado because I wanted to go back to Chevy trucks Two days after I got it the engine when cold cranks and dies then idles extremely rough until it warms up Dealership service tells me they never heard of a Colorado doing that before Translation We probably cant fix that The truck is fine bodywise and interiorwise but in my humble opinion you might want to wait until they get all the bugs out of this new 4 cylinder powerplant
0,I would have to say that this car is the most practical performance saloon on the market today The amount of power you get from that 42litre V8 is astonishing The handling far surpasses anything else in this range Audis of old used to be really nose heavy and the understeer alot but with this one you really have the confidence to shove it into the bends I think this car is better than an M3
1,Dont get me wrong the car is so much fun to drive and looks great but the interior quality is very bad and does not compare to any German or Japanese cars quality It feels a little cheap My friend drives a 2008 BMW M3 which is comparable to the vette in power and price but the interior quality on the beemer is much better than my corvette for the same price Some of my interior trim is coming off and the car is still under warranty
0,This car is all that is cracked up to be they put all their eggs into this automobile It handles like a scapel and is so quick that I have never had this kind of thrill I have had an M3 and a 1997 911 and no car ever has delivered like this one Worth the money and what you can expect to get in mileage with this kind of power
1,I have owned Corvettes since my first in 1974 I bought it new upon my return from Vietnam I traded my 2004 in on this one and it is by far the best one I have owned My next one may be the new ZR1 that just came out but I am not sure
0,Ive owned a total of 4 different Audis based on the A4 so far a 18T a 28 an S4 and now an RS4 Clearly the RS4 is vastly superior to the earlier cars surprise surprise Huge fun to drive awesome acceleration outstanding handling   and stopping power  at the same time comfortable fine for everyday driving it easily seats four people Still in lust with it after a year or so of owning it a total sleeper it doesnt turn heads until you stomp it Then  it moves
1,I guess I can start by saying this car is my midlife crisis car anyway the car performs everytime time I put my foot into It fires like a bullet no complaints for power but there are some other problems so beware My vehicle has had molding on the driver   and passengers side replace twice for peeling Front windshield crack and replaced due to body stress as descibe in my documentation Rear differential went out grining noise when backing up or going around curves Dealer wants to add rear differential TSBadditive waste of time My passenger door has a continous rattle in the center of the panel with very little volume on speakers GM fix is adding foam to interior of door doesnt work
0,Having previously owned an LS 400 Lexus BMW 325 and the S4 2005 model I find that the Audi RS4 without any doubt it is the most exciting and most comfortable car Ive had the pleasure to drive The interior design is exquisite and the aggressive exterior finishes this car superbly Then of course there is the V8 42 FSI engine which tops it all with that purfect sound to go with it A wee bit on the expensive side but I truly believe one gets what one pays for with this unique car
1,Reliability is not there Electrical system drains battery so car will not start if car is left parked for more than 10 days So many things on this car are attached to the batteryit does nothing but kill battery Try taking this car to the airport and come back 2 weeks later and see what happens When youre not driving for even short periods in must be plugged in to a charger Dealer says all is working properly even the car manual says battery will not last more than 25 days
0,I came out of an S4 and bought the RS4 after an ample test drive The driving dynamics and engine feel remind me of me 1997 M3 first of three I owned which I felt handled better than the 2001 and 2004 models I had Its still a little nose heavy but compared to the S4 its really hardly noticeable and the braking engine and lateral stability are outstanding Its really a wonderful machine and the all wheel drive in the midwest makes it a near must If you are an M3 fan you should really try this car before the next M3 especially if you are in the midwest or northeast Personally even though its heavier I couldnt bring myself to give up the all wheel drive Try it and see
1,Soon after I got this car something inside the door panel started to rattle Had to go to 3 different dealer to finally get one willing to take the door panel off to fix Squeaksrattle all over the car when driving on rough surface Roof when stored in trunk squeaks like mad Window squeaks when rolled all the way up where it hits the roof Dealer would apply some lube which works for about a week then rattlesqueaks returns and becomes worse Get real people with 400hp the acceleration isnt much faster than a V6 Toyota Camry with 270hp It probably is not worth to endure the noisy tire and all the poor interior
0,The best car I ever had satisfaction for someone that has had the best cars the mixture of performances in the RS4 make it the best car in its class
1,Ive had a lot of different sport cars and roadsters which includes MGs to 1967 Firebird 1972 Chevelle SS 1967 Triump BMWs Z3 Z4 and the 3 series which then led me back to machines that can perform like my Harley Davidson VRod with a few mods pushs over 120hp Nothing even comes close to coming back to an American made quality product like the Corvette You really need to start looking at what GM has produced its better quality than any foreign car that Ive owned in the last 20 years Chevy you rock
0,I just recently purchased the RS4 and every time that I just look at my car which is often I get a silly grin on my face and my heart starts to race I remember feeling this way when I had my first love Forget the performance of this car theres nothing out there in its class to dispute that Some of my freinds said to me that I should go with something that stands out like an M3 but since I have had this car I have had several people comment on what an amazing looking car I had The people that had to inspect the car for my title told me that they where fighting for the honor to test it Power comfort ride look and an immaculate finish to everything in this car make the price well worth it
1,I went from a 2001 ZO6 to a 2007 coupe The coupes ride is signifigantly smoother than the ZO6 and I recommend the coupe as a daily driver vs ZO6 The coupe is very powerful   and styling cant be beat I receive a lot of turned heads   and waives from other Vette drivers Gasoline mileage is good not great lots of cargo space but interior fit   and finish lacking Has been in and out of the shop for warranty issues cigarette lighter not working  glove box openclose latch keeps breaking  cheap plastic Removable top although light in weight for its size needs two people to safely taking onoff As a previous owner of a ZO6 Id opt for the coupe every time as ZO6 is designed for racing
0,Undoubtedly the best sedan available The power and handling are awesome The gas mileage is better than an Audi S4 The silver interior is breathtaking The voice control navigation and MMI are all very much intuitive have yet to open the manuals with questions on any Everything is executed with class Its not an inexpensive car but its worth it
1,With out doubt the best performance bang for the buck Unbelievable fuel mileage from a 400 HP engine Drove it up to Utah from So Cal averaged 305 MPG over 1750 miles No problems yet Car is great as a daily driver gets compliments were ever you take it Also surprisingly easy to insure
0,I bought my car about 2 months ago its been a pleasure to drive it everytime I get a chance Its fast in control a focal point on the road You have all kinds of people waving you down begging you to hammer down on it so they can see it for a few seconds at least and get to hear it take off I dont have the shaking of the steering wheel problem but my car has been consuming a lot of oil Other than that the car is a lot of fun and for what I get back its worth way more than what I paidThe more you push on the gas the more the engine calls for more The S button is off the hook it sounds great
1,It took a little time for me to get used to a car with this much power but I really enjoy the car The riding comfort is great the car rides very smoothly however it is a little noisy However the car is not as hot rough riding as its predecessors Interior design is not bad and there is enough storage room for most items There are some minor things that could have been done a little differently but they are very minor The exterior of the car is beautiful a true American sports car we can all be proud of Gas mileage is great I get 22 in the city and 30 on the hwy So far quality and reliability are very good Only one problem which has been corrected
0,This is by far the best overall sports carsedan Ive ever owned The car is incredibly quick smooth and stable through all gears and under all conditions I dare say its even practical with a huge trunk and ample back seats for kids Mileage isnt the cars strongest suit but in context given this cars uber performance its quite good about 19 mpg under normal driving conditions Excellent interior and fit and finsish Audi did it right  truly a great car
1,I traded a 2004 350Z on this car I also drove a Porsche Cayman S before purchasing The Corvette has unmatched acceleration but is not as tossable in corners as the Z or Porsche I am very please with the car and use it as my daily driver in all seasons except the winter
0,The RS4 is sweet its fast it corners the best and o does it like fuel If you ever owned a S4 you must try the RS4 It is so much better After 1500 miles Im sold that this car is well worth the money However I have 1 concern There is a vibration in steering column at 61  65 MPH The Audi engineers need to fix this quickly before it becomes a standard complaint about this most wounderful automobile Congratulations Audi you have out done yourselves
1,This car will make you believe in American sports cars As you get on to the highway shifting into second the back slips just a little and you look down doing seventyfive and the sheer adrenaline cause your to fling it into third and push the hammer all the way down Next thing you know your in sixth gear and didnt realize it Seriously though the handling on this car is unreal add that with the huge powerplant and 400 hundred horsepower I have driven a Z06 Viper SRT10 and a Masserati gransport  this car is only beaten by the Z06 If you have the extra 20K get the Z06 but if not this is an unreal midlife crisis
0,The moment I turn on the engine wow Sounds so solid I mean solid Once you press the S button it sounds even sweeter Handling is fabulous acceleration is top notch Yes is a bit pricy but nothing compares at this moment so you pretty much have no choice
1,This car is awesome GM finally did it right Several times they have come close but never actually did it What do I mean by they finally did it For the first time they have not allowed a specific price point to keep the car from becoming what it should have done many times over The greatest American muscle car that has basically no limitations You have to spend 200K to get a car that can even come close to the all around performance of this car
0,Yes it is worth the money Lets get that out of the way first The RS4 does everything my STi did and more Considering it costs twice as much as a STiEvo it had better do more and it does Much more comfortable and refined for daily commuting but when you get into the higher revs its a beast The exhaust note is amazing and there is so much torque at all rpms Well balanced handling and its so much easier to drive quickly thru the hills Im even getting the same fuel economy as I was in the STi at 18mpg  4 more cylinders 120 more horsepower just as fast and no increase in fuel consumption Brilliant
1,Ive owned my 2007 Corvette since October 13 2006 and have had problems with the electronics in alarm system which continue severe problems with rattles coming from behind the dashboard due to broken welds and roof pins that were too small and a bad shock absorber The first repair to fix the broken weld took almost 6 weeks After a month and less than 500 miles the rattle is back Great looking car with substantial performance but extremely poor quality I wouldnt recommend anyone spend  dollar45000 or more for such a poor quality car which inturn leads to continue fustrations trying to get your problems resolved To be honest I expected a higher quality car for the price I paid
0,My key concern when transitioning from a B5 500 hp S4 was the performance Now after owning the car for about 1 month the performance is not my focus The car is blazing fast Yet Audis execution of everything else impressed the hell out of me The car is so solid smooth and easy to drive everyday I cant say that about my old S4 it was getting tough The car is much happier at 135 though really smooth Like it wants to do 190 its amazing I strongly suggest the car to any modified S4 owner they wont want to go back to turbos
1,I love this car The performance is unbelievable The styling is sexy The quality is first rate My only complaint so far is some of the plastic in the interior is not up to the rest of the car The best
0,Ive owned the car for just about 6 weeks and its been all fun There is no other car at this price that combines elite sportcarlevel performance 5passenger capability topnotch luxury features 5star safety and allwheeldrive
1,So far at 7000 miles the car has been flawless Explosive acceleration delightful torque at any speed The car is a red Z51 convertible 6 speed manual This car has a dual personality If you want to just commute normally its relatively quiet smooth and docile If you drop the hammer it turns into an animal loud and brash Even frightening if you are not expecting it Despite stiffer Z51 option ride is firm but not harsh I was impressed also with the stiffness of the structure despite being a convertible So far no rattles and a door squeak went away as weather warmed up
0,This car is pure exhilaration It is extremely quick hugs the corners and has a rocksolid build quality The engine sounds great too This is a fantastic everyday car and not too thirsty given its 420 hp engine
1,I will totally surprised at the ride My wifes first words about Corvettes is that they rode rough I was thoroughly surprised and please with the ride and really surprised how well the car handled
0,This car is nothing short of perfect Its incredibly fast grips the corners and has rock solid build quality This car is without compromise  its a rockin sports car with an ample back seat and a huge trunk Im even getting decent gas mileage I love this car
1,I was pleasantly suprised by how good a daily driver this car is I was expecting the ride to be rough and loud but in fact it is quite liveable The interior is not quite up to par when compared to a Porsche but its good enough The engine is insane and so above and beyond what you need There is so much torque availabe even when the revs are are on the low end which makes it alot more flexible their foreign counterparts Steering isnt quite as nible as I would like but still is quite good Overall I enjoy driving this car more than my previous car 996 Porsche Be sure to get a CAGS eliminator installed that allows you to bypass the 1st to 4th shift gas saving mode
0,This is the most outstanding car Ive ever driven I also own a Mercedes SL600 with a Kleemann power upgrade and in the morning I find myself reaching for the S8 keys This car is a very fast sedan but what I really love about it besides the all wheel drive for Wisconsin winters is that it is so comfortable to drive and that the dash layout is so simple and intuitive This is the first sedan that I have ever found to be exciting to drive The paddle shifters are way cool
1,Just took delivery of an 07 coupe Lemans Blue casmere interior LT3 chrome wheels magnetic suspension and NAV system My first Vette never had a sports car before so I cant compare it I am still in shock that I have it only 300 mi in two days no problems yet It is everything and more that I hoped for Interior is fantastic and comfy the leather sport seats are excellent The car is so classy without being in your face I already have had so many strangers both young old male and female comment and want to know about it It blows my mind I dont know if they upgraded the quality of the interior for 07 but it looks and feels first class to me Buy one you wont regret it
0,I traded my 997 to to get what I perceived to be a peaceful luxury car that delivers a violent soulful motor on command I couldnt be happier No more annoying tire noise competing with the sometimes flatuent contrived exhaust note Instead I get full luxury including doublepaned windows and felt lined wheelwells to ensure tranquility punctuated by refined violence upon driver demand I also get an ipod interface and bluetooth When I miss my 997 I can always take out my 87 911 for a visceral run And when I really require a jolt my F355 delivers without fail The S8 is always the car I reach for first that says a lot
1,We bought our 2007 Equinox brand new noticed a smell and inside windows kept fogging up this summer Found that our carpet in the back was completely soaked with water By the time we found the issue our carpets had a black mold on them I have a small child who is a severe asthmatic and I feel this is a safety issue Our Equinox is currently back at the dealership for recurrent leaks So far the dealership cant figure out the source of the leak so AGAIN I am in limbo renting a car hopefully it wont take 6 weeks like the first time
0,I wanted a car that was good in the snow but also had good performance this fits the bill
1,I love the exterior my 2007 Equinox XM radio is a great feature However interior is full of issues Heated seats work intermittently Dont wait until winter to try them You might be out in the cold This feature isnt for the duration of the 5 yr 100000 mile warranty Check them throughout the year even in the summer Right passenger airbag sensor doesnt always work GM recall for this Driver side seat mechanism didnt work once for 2 days Took it to dealership to fix Chrome center panel reflects sun causing blinding glare when driving Remember some things are only under warranty for 2 years so dont delay taking your car in for repairs Make sure its in computer system everytime
0,The is such a great car I bought an S550 4matic for myself but there just wasnt enough power there for me I saw the S8 drive by and my son who is 13 and knows a lot about cars told me I had to check it out So we drove right to the Audi dealership and ordered it I have since given my wife the S550 and she wants to have my car I really enjoy this car and it is powerful and has the fourwheel drive We live right outside of Philly and we do get snow so that four wheel drive is great to have It you can buy it I would definitely recommend doing so
1,I bought the car when i was pregnant The headrest is a vision blocker when trying to look in the blind spotsthe tiny windows in the back The seats are now as hard as bleachers think its causing my back problems The plastic dash board and steering wheel are So hard to clean Not to mention that the trim around the shifter is a huge chrome piece that of course the sun hits and blinds you while you are driving This could cause an accident Bought brand new in 07 still havent reached the gas mileage that its supposed to be getting and i do a lot of highway driving when bought it got 16MPGs now only at 183MPGs HHMM Sound system WHAT HAPPENED
0,The S8 is the German automobile perfected Flawless engine superior ride and handling classic styling and the absolute best interior available at any price point Compared to the Jaguar XJ8 much more refined Compared to the BMW 750760 better in almost every way ergonomically Also far superior interior Compared to the Mercedes S550 again the interior is more luxurious and the engine blows the S550 away
1,I have to admit this is a nice looking vehicle but UNRELIABLE This is my daughters car and there have been 5 times the vehicle would not start The key would even get stuck in the ignition Unfortunately recently we have found out this is not uncommon Our dealership service dept is great but cant find out what the problem is although they have done some repairs Also headlight has blown twice Definitely a cheap feeling vehicle to match the price does accelerate well I have had 3 trailblazers and there is no comparison Would not downgrade that far The ride is comparable to the Ford Escort The equinox is a disposable vehicle Come on Chevy you gotta beef it up
0,I decided that maybe Audi had just created the perfect luxury car After 3k miles I believe they have It is perfectly silent when you want it to be Want to be sporty One or two down shifts and a tap of the right foot and you know you are in the right car The electronics are well thought out too Handling stuns The throttle is not too sensitive No problem did they fix it Looks Subjective yes but it makes a very discrete statement I am very happy my S8 And I dont miss my 997 a bit
1,Ive owner over 30 cars and dont give praises lightly however I have been very happy with this vehicle I traded in an 05 Trailblazer because it was woefully underpowered but have been extremely pleased by the pep in my Equinox The 6 cyl is more than enough power When I park next to the Lexus Crossover I have trouble telling them apart and cannot for the life of me imagine what features I am missing for an additional  dollar20k My Equinox is fully loaded and with the OnStar GPS system the vehicle has everything I could need It drives great on the highway where I average over 24 MPG and get around 22 MPG around town I strongly recommend it to anyone who asks
0,I traded in a BMW 645 Cabriolet for the S8 and at the time was worried that I might miss the BMW After 4 days of driving the S8 I can honestly say that I made the right move And I moved up in a big way
1,I bought the Equinox brand new with 0 miles in Feb 07 coming up on 2 yrs of owning it I still have mixed feelings It handles horribly in the snow even with the AWD feature Its been extremely reliable other than 2 factory recalls winshield   and airbag the stereo isnt that great buttons are breaking off engine knocks even w regular oil changes It has a hard time getting up steep country hills Very sleek vehicle Its black Decent gas milage Needs a bigger trunk and the hatch is heavy and slow to open Its ok for now but Im already looking at buying something else for winter Its good for summer driving I wouldnt purchase another I think its too costly for the quality of it
0,I have owned and driven all cars from S500 to Porsche to BMW to Maserati to Ferrari This is by far the best car I have owned and driven It is a car which one can drive hard or soft The full option version is one to go for which is with the Bang and Olufsen stereo  this is a must it really improves a sound quality
1,Overall I am well satisfied with my Equinox having owned it for over a year Have had no mechanical problems yet Very comfortable and good on long road trips Gas mileage good on highwaynot so good around town 17 inch Bridgestone tires will hydroplane in a heartbeat in heavy rain Scary Interior planning could be better Rear seat doesnt fold flat and front cupholder interferes with hand brake Rear cargo curtain is a joke Dont waste your money buying it Decent vehicle so far but still not the quality of my 2000 Volvo Detroit still cant get it right
0,As with the few other owners I debated the choices When it came right down to it making the selection for an S8 was more about uniqueness performance comfort and subtlety What I didnt expect when making the decision and to my great surprise since it is almost impossible to test drive them prior to purchase was 1 how great it handles drives and performs 2 how modern the electronics are iPod and satellite and telephone integration systems and suspension control 3 how comfortable it is AND how much fun it is to drive and 4 that it keeps getting better I find the power band perfectly tweaked for a luxury sedan  great performance as an automatic amazing performance as a manual tiptronic
1,Have owned the Equinox for 6 months now and all in all is a great value We purchased an 07 1LT with the 17 chrome wheels which make it look great I like the sporty look ride and handling but im not that impressed with the gas mileage I get the same mileage with a 2000 grand cherokee as this I also hate the recessed windshield it is a pain in the rear to brush snow off my hood is scratched and chipped after one winter
0,Its an awesome car Had it for about 2 months now and yet every time I turn the engine on I cant help but grin like a 12 year old in a candy store Having had various luxury cars over the last several years I can honestly say that Ive never seen a more complete package  its an absolute joy to drive Even though its relatively similar to the A8 it turns heads everywhere I often sit in heavy traffic and let me tell you people especially other drivers stare The only problem that some people might have is that it can get quite uncomfortable when you have several pairs of eyes glued to you for extended periods of time while you wait for the lights to change
1,We were forced to purchase a new car after the Jeep dealer ruined our 05 Jeep Liberty We really did not want to be in the market for a car and yet here we were We began my search in the beginning of September and wanted to get a year end deal on a 2007 model After reviewing a number of models we settled on the Pontiac Torrent Although this was the first choice we gravitated to the Equinox as we could not find a Torrent with the equipment desired However if we could have assembled the car ourselves we would have put the Torrent front on the Equinox rear Since purchased we put on about 4400 trouble free miles We have not had to take the car back for any adjustments or correc
0,Drive this car on Highway 1 from Carmel to San Simeon and you will be hooked for life Better by far than my SL 500 Handling acceleration and the paddles  pure fun  truly wow
1,I love my Equinox Its a nice size SUV not too small not too big I like the way it handles rides drives and looks Plenty of room for shopping and hauling everything I need Sporty enough not to look like an old ladies car I liked the warranty and all the features like the computer readouts on tire pressure gas milage so forth I thought about a Toyota but wanted to go with American made
0,My decision was between a Mercedes S550 4 matic sport and the Audi S8 The S550 is nice but the S8 just felt like something more special The v10 engine smooth and quiet at normal speeds and unbelievably poweful and baritone when you want it to be and the special S interior and exterior felt like something a step above the norm Even the ride with the std 20 inch rims is wonderful in comfort mode unbelievable given the potholes in my part of the country I average about 155 mpg 70 percent city30 percent highway Not great but hey that v10 powernoise has got to come from somewhere Net no regrets so far
1,Rented this one as a replacement for my truck Ride is comfortable handles nice with sufficient acceleration to get onto busy California freeways I didnt like the parking brake location hard to reach when engaged and the fact that the rear seat does not fold down even with the back floor made it hard to put large objects inside Overall not a vehicle I could live with long term
0,This car is truly a joy to drive I have a Maserati as well as an Aston Martin however every morning when I wake up and grap my keys I find myself continually grabbing the Audi Keys
1,Ive heard a lot of negative comments about previous year models but Ive had no problems with my Equinox Its roomy but not to big to manuever Back seat is great Great options and decent gas mileage
0,Like most other BMW owners that bought their vehicles with RFTs I too had a less than positive experience It was a rougher ride than my 02 M3 after 15k miles Im ready for my first tire replacements at 30K miles and fortunately took it in for service before buying new tires Complained about them to the service guy and he finally agreed they werent getting rave reviews and said under his breath that people switching to regular tires noticed a marked improvement in handling noise and comfort He also said BMW now sells a Mobility kit for nonRFT tires comes standard with new Ms apparently that is basically a fancy tire repair in a can Ordering new Michelins today
1,I bought my Equinox just two months ago I have a horrible experience with it so far Just after two months 3000km loud noise appeared in drive side front wheel bearing Its high pitched humming noise very loud and unbearable after just cuple minutes of driving Even more frustrating was dealing with GM warranty service They didt have bearing assembly to replace it had to be ordered and Im still awaiting for it 3 weeks passed already GM doesnt provide replacement car and I have to drive Equinox with faulty bearing It is become a torture  noise getting more and more unbearable I had to cancel my travel plans limit my driving to minimum Fuel consumption is very high  horrible
0,Now four months into the ownership experience and really happy with this vehicle Superb power Drop dead gorgeous looks Nothing handles better Bought used and saved big bucks
1,Fuel economy not as good at 17  21 as I had hoped but better than a Hemi or Silverado or larger SUV With gas at  dollar250 a gallon  dollar45 fills her up Larger gas tank The designers made some bad choices in the interior as ashtray is optional in a choice with cup holder which is attached to the middle fold down arm glove compartment which all in all is just not a great design Every car should have standard ashtray Cup holders on an extended arm just asks for drinks to wiggle shake and spill The center tray bottom gets dirty quickly and is hard to clean And the seats and the covering comfy but better scotch I have the gray metallic gets dirty easy Larger visors better sound
0,The 335i Convertible is a great year round car Hardtop is splendid and top down is well an ideal convertible experience Performance with the 300HP Twin Turbo is seamless and strong Nice exhaust note Would not recommend the Sport Package Tires are different sized front to rear and terrible runflats Bridgestones They were OK until about 7000 miles and then feathered cupped and droned all the time Awful experience dealer and BMW were not helpful Beware these tires on Sport Package cannot be rotated and the Run Flats ruined my BMW experience Never again Otherwise car is great but tires are so important as that is your contact with the road Shame on BMW for using that tire
1,This model is much better than its competition We tried all of them and were not impressed The 2007 is far better than the 2006 model they hardly compare The price is also great with the incentives out there now it makes it even more attractive
0,Very fun good looking car to drive The acceleration is amazing and effortless Very quiet cabin and poised until youre surprised by a bump This car is very customizable to your preferences Having the comfort access gives this car an extra lux quality However all the technology makes me afraid that its going to be an expensive car to maintain in the long run The seatbelt assist arm has acted up a few times already City gas mileage is horrible but highway is better than my last car avg 1727 At the end Im glad I bought this car The best car Ive ever owned by far
1,I enjoy getting behind the wheel of this SUV For a midsize it has a lot of power and room The fuel economy is not bad and it could be worse I like the style inside and out
0,After actually ordering a car for the first time I was very excited to own the ultimate driving machine However it became the ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE The tapping noise the engine made should never happen on a premium car like this It became a battle to have BMW admit to it and have it fixed They are well aware of the problem yet still sell new cars with this defect My car was damaged at the dealer trying to have this repair done and this was a result of BMW not standing behind their product These cars are overpriced and overrated
1,Watch what the window sticker says when purchasing this vehicle On the side where everything the vehicle has is listed it says Unit produced without XM satellite radio The salesman and I skimmed the list of features and assumed it had satellite and low and behold it didnt Funny it didnt list that it didnt have sunroof Thankfully the dealership where I purchased my Equinox honored the satellite radio and had it installed and hard wired Con for this vehile it cannot get satellite through the radio Something about the electrical system Besides that I love this car
0,I picked this car up last week as certified preowned and its the ONLY way to go with BMW You get the benefits of a new car in terms of warranties for the price of a used car I got a maintenance plan to cover up to 100000 miles which is a MUST if you plan on keeping your car and not leasing The one I got is fully loaded with every possible upgrade and the incredible thing is that I got it all for under  dollar30K out the door This car brand new with its options would have easily cost over  dollar50K
1,I am not very happy with gm I bought my car used with factory warranty to 100000 mi The car has 53000mi My transmission has been slipping I took it to dealer they didnt fix it they gave it a new gasket supposedly tear down transmission replaced side cover gasket Im not happy with gm Im going to need to keep complaining for them to fix it properly Im worried transmission is already on its way out it sickens i bought car 2007 used 32000 mi I luv style of car and the way it rides but Im afraid of keeping it to long I think I have lemon signed depressed
0,I love this car Wonderful handling with an excellent ride Power is more than I need I am getting around 2021 MPG overall and 28 to 30 on the highway I have not had it in the snow yet but with allwheel drive I am sure it will do fine I have not had as much pleasure in driving for many years
1,I have had my HHR since November 2008 bought it used with 32000 miles came with 12000 bumper to bumper warranty from chevy The dealership will lie to keep from doing anything under warranty My wipers have quit repeatedly during rain storms I make an appointment to get it seen to and they lie and say they checked it out but didnt I have two recalls for my car but the dealership wont even schedule me to get the repairs done says I dont really need them the car did not come with runnerboards or mud flaps so every time you drive anywhere near gravel it flies up the side of my car and skins the paint in front of the back door and the warranty doesnt take care of that either
0,Generally Im pleased with my 328xi and looking forward to winter in the Colorado mountains I like the 6 speed manual transmission although I think the car is slightly underpowered compared to my Audi A4 20 I love the convenience locks and the pushbutton start So far no mechanical problems but I think the no flat tires are overly loud on the freeway All in all the car sticks to the road like glue and is fun to drive on mountain roads not so fun in tight parking lots
1,I really love to drive my HHR LT but the exterior body has gotten really bad I live on a gravel road and the the rims are flaking off and I have absolutely no paint left in front of my rear wheel wells It is starting to rust all ready and I have under 28000 miles on it Took it back to dealer at under 10000 miles and they really didnt care Have replaced the sway bar links already too Just a cheap car Gas mileage should be better than 25 average but its not Bad handling in winter conditions also should be noted
0,Very pleased Handles very well with a neutral flat and connected feel to the car Ergonomics fit me very well and interior is roomy for a compact car Run flats are acceptable ridewise although once worn Ill replace with Michelins and put some fixflat in trunk Bluetooth works very well Fantastic leather and interior fitfinish is great but glove box is smallish For the high price of admission the standard sound system should be better  okay but the Logic 7 system shouldnt be an option at this price Push button start system is I think unique Some may say its odd or gimmicky Good power but if youre a power monger pop for the 335
1,I have had my Sunburst Orange HHR for 7 months now It sure gets a lot of looks The pickup is great and it handles well 3 seasons of the year I have 3 complaints though It does not handle very well in the snow important feature up here in Canada The cupholders and electric window buttons are awkward to reach Other than that I absolutely love this car
0,Very impressed with this car Handling engine are excellent Absolutely no complaints
1,Surprise The off the line power is great The interior comfort is super The quality is great in and out Get the mud flapsor the dirt will hit the vehicle This replaced a Land Rover and I am not looking back
0,I love my new 328i wagon Plenty of room for two little dog crates even with the back seat up Get decent MPG certainly better than my x5 got Handles wonderfully rides GREAT iDrive is fun GPS is amazing and I get lots of compliments on the color combo barbaro red with tan interior The thing I hate are the runflat tires I have my second flat in the 4 months I own the car Not the cars fault but I now need to take hours to drive to the dealer wait for them to sell me another tire I dont have time for this not to mention the cost I want to be able to changefix the flat and get on with my life
1,Bought 07 HHR LT fall limited edition Love it The black chrome looks great Very comfortable great mileage I am 6 and there is a lot of room Handling is great not too much body roll It is a lot of fun Rides like a much more expensive car
0,I never expected to say that my VW Passat had more attention to detail than the car Ive waited so long to own but my BMW falls short in some areas including a less impressive dash display a headrest that tilts too far forward and cant be adjusted a trip computer stop watch that must be manually reset for each trip it auto reset on the VW a manual that must be stored in the trunk the VW had a compartment for it under the steering wheel back window controls are situated where I expect the front to be door lock control is on the dash rather than the drivers door forces you to get back in the car if you forget to unlock all doors before getting out
1,I received my HHR on a Friday and was just starting to explore all the features when 4 days later on Tuesday a gentleman ran a stop sign and I hit him going about 3035 miles per hour It was a very scary few minutes I never even had time to hit the brake No one was severely injured I got out of my vehicle and walked away with only the injury from the seatbelt The air bag also went off The windshield never broke There was no damaged from the front seats to the back of the vehicle The front end took the whole impact of the crash My truck was totaled though It only had 345 miles on it With the 5 star safety rating and my proof of it Ill be buying another HHR
0,Ive been an Infiniti driver for the past 5 years G35 coupe and FX35 Whenever its time to buy Ive considered BMW but never could get past the sticker shock and brake dust problem It was all over with one look at the BMW 335i hardtop convertible Then I made a bigger mistake and test drove it wow I had to have it This is the most awesome ride ever I get tons of compliments from people and openingclosing the top stops traffic Definitely a keeper if I can get the technical issues fixed
1,I love it You can put a 2x4x8 in vehicle with no trouble Boxes of tools Best little car Im 6334 tall 260 lbs So far 13645 miles on it
0,335i has exceptional power and handling It is by far the best it its class The iPod adapter is worth the extra money
1,Im very happy with the HHR however I am from the northeast and this winter has been very coldThe reason I bring the weather up is in the morning when I get on the hughway the engine is quite loud Getting to the highway I have a little dip or two to go over When I do go over them it sounds like I lost my under carriage After like five miles this to calms down The car has a low front end so stay on well plowed roads
0,After an exhaustive and exhausting search my wife and I finally decided to get our first BMW Having driven a series of 5 Saabs in a row it was a time to move on We explored BMW Audi Infiniti Lexus Acura Volvo and Cadillac Based on reviews prestigemarket segment price features and overall driving quality the BMW was a clear winner Love the car and the engine is amazing It continues to win me over every time we take it out Mileage has been better than expected and we are enjoying learning how to use all of the features the car offers
1,HHR is definetely a summer car not a winter car Ice gets between the bottom of lower front fender and door and freezes up preventing us from getting in and out of car Outside of that it has been a great car my average MPG is 27
0,End of lease was nearing on my Audi A4 32 Quattro and I planning to purchase the car Bored and nothing to do a couple weekends ago I decided to stop by the closest BMW dealer to check out the 335i After the test drive I was instantly sold Before I pulled the trigger drove the G35 and the IS 350 but clearly the 335i was the Ultimate Driving Machine Tons of power available at any speed Handling is superb and the car is incredibly balanced Cant say that about the A4 Fit and finish of the car is first rate Interior is clean and laid out nicely Great stereo The sport seats keep you firmly in place Awesome car to drive Fast and fun
1,I have almost had 3 wrecks due to the blind spot dealing with the windshield pillars They are very thick for such a small vehicle The windshield needs to be bigger when I put the visor down I have to slump down in the seat to seat under the dumb thing GM did move for 2009 the window controls to the door they are a pain in front of the gear shift The cup holders are too close together so you cannot have to larger cokes in them and then the armrest are in the way to get to your drink It needs to have a console and lots more cubby holes There is a lot of space that is wasted that could have been utilized for storage The storage in the door is way to small needs to accomodate drinks
0,Had a 528i before thought I would never drive a smaller car but since the 328 is now bigger its just perfect Handles and hugs the road so well Cant wait to try it in the snow used to park the 528 when it snowed
1,I have owned mine for about a month now I love it I did read the reviews prior to purchase so some small things I agree with The door locks why are they so tall Makes hard to have your arm on door Also interior easily staining is so true I mean water on seats stained and that is so odd to me I was frustrated as my car didnt come with trunk mat I did shop around The dealear wanted  dollar104 for the rubber mat I actually found a lot of them on ebay for  dollar49 So check that out if you need one Other than that all is great I dont see any issues Everyone loves it and my kids finally have room to relax Great car dont hesitate
0,Is there a word greater than great That is the word I would use The sound system is the best I have ever heard The reviews where drivers say they look for excuses to drive this car are true Believe it when you read it I love the power the sound the illuminated outside lighting when you unlock the car at night My last car was a Crossfire I thought is was impressive until I drove this car I have had it more than a month and know that all of my future cars will be BMWs I have an automatic and added the sports package If you are reading this and considering getting a 328i sedan well dont walk but run to the local dealership You wont be sorry It is worth every penny
1,This car is a fleet vehicle for the company I work for I have put on about 50k miles on it in the first year so far and have had no problems at all mechanicaly The engine is suprisingly quick for a 4 cyl My only complaint is the seats They stain way too easy I spilled a bottle of water and it left a stain I have the gray interior I would reccomend black or get leather All other features about inside are great
0,With around 800 miles on my brand new 335i sedan the fuel pump died The symptoms were long crank times power losshesitation and extreme vibration Its been over 10 days and no word on a replacement Stay away from this first year production if you can From what I remember this car was fast fun and superagile when she was running
1,Over all not too bad of a vehicle It would be nice to be driving something where I was not surrounded by plastic when I was inside I usually get much better then the rated gas mileage around 38 mpg highway if I watch my speed
0,I love my new 328i BMW just keeps making cars that make me and many others so happy No wonder editors of enthusiast magazines have to make public announcements explaining they are not on the Bavarian payroll yes BMW advertises but so do the other manufacturers when these cars keep winning headto head comparisons with their competitors My third 3 series and the most luxurious and comfortable yet the car has grown with my own girth and obviously its not just me enjoying the extra space as Im seeing more and more on the road If you enjoy driving and you are looking for a smaller car that just makes you smile when you have to push it harder than normal this is the car for you
1,I bought my HHR for my wife in 2007 for a nice car to drive back and fourth to work Mileage has been solidly in the upper 20s with mixed city HWY When we are on the open highway I have gotten as good as 33 but stick around 31 most of the time The car is solid it is just a base but the auto start was a deal setter for my wife Great little car But just a few weeks ago i got a safety recall on the little beast Come on GM get your heads in the game This final recall is the last nail in the coffin for my GM purchasing days I just bought a Ford fusion for myself And my wife pretty much stole it from me Looks like GM just cant seem to build something with out needing to recall it
0,I have driven the car for 3 months put on nearly 3000 miles and I am having a blast Outstanding acceleration and handling and all speeds
1,I thought I loved my car I have now owned it about 8 months The paint is chipping my power steering has gone out the traction was horrible this winter and when more than 1 window is down there is a suction almost There are several things that I do like but I dont believe my vehicle should be having problems yet and I am upset thats why I bought a new vehicle to not have problems for reliability
0,I drove a 2002 BMW 325i and it was a fun car to drive Just bought the 328i with Premium and Sports PKG This car is powerful and fun to drive The car feels solid and the communication with the road is second to none The engine power and overall excellent driving experience is what you would expect from a BMW The brakes are solid and make you feel confident your care will stop on a dime Transmission engine and every other component work in precise unison The car still gets a lot of stares when on the road Im always looking for any excuse to drive it The car is pricey in comparison to some of the competition but worth the money
1,I am very happy with my purchase This car is great Great gas mileage looks great and didnt hurt my wallet I love the remote start and power everything I didnt get the sunroof though with much regret I have always been worried about it leaking I wouldnt trade my Chevy for anything in the world I got the orange color which totaly suites me Its easy to get in and out of rides great and is very comfortable The cargo space in the back is also a major plus I have plenty of room for me my husband and child Its a great buy
0,This is my first BMW and wow am I impressed This car is flat out amazing The best attributes are those characteristicts with the pure driving experience If you love to drive then you will love this car The steering is amazingly precise the brakes are strong yet smooth the manual transmission is a joy to operate the clutch is easy to use and then theres the engine That twin turbo I6 alone is reason enough to buy this car To hear it rev is like pure automotive symphony I love to rev this engine probably as much as the engine loves to rev Cannot wait to hit the track one day It also excels on the freeway  never got uncomfortable during an 11 hour trip I love it
1,We are very satisfied with our HHR We have three small children and they have plenty of room as well as the front two passengers It is very hard to use the cupholders up front while driving Other than that the only other odd thing is the battery placement What is up with that I havent even seen the battery yet I hope all of the rear storage doesnt have to be removed to get to it I am disabled and this would pose a problem for myself Other than those small things the SUV is great in every way
0,This is my first BMW car and now I understand why it is called German engineering This car has great driving performances The turns are sharp and the body itself is kept close to the ground On the freeway it feels very steady and not floating This car is very low and has a thick side skirt compared to other sedans The navigation is also very useful but a bit slow and it has shut down once then which I had to reboot the car to start it again Overall the exterior of the car looks really cute and a bit chubby compared to the coupe which looks slim and sporty This car is worth the money because of all the features and the driving experience
1,Had no problems so far with the vehicle at almost 35000 milescomfortable heated front seats large blind spots to rear mirrors could be much larger as in former Pontiac Grand Prixs previously owned much road noise when sun roof is opened impossible to hear or talk above 30mph noisy tires
0,There is a reason why this vehicle has won so many accolades over the years This is one of the most involving and enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven It feels like it is on rails the whole time cornering so effortlessly it almost makes you believe that you are a world class driver Ive really never driven anything that imparts such a safe and stable feeling The almost 5050 weight distribution helps along with a wonderful system of power suspension and brakes You can probably find some other car that has a few more toys on it but you will not find a more involving and beautiful drive Every time I get in the car it makes me want to take the long way home
1,I have now own my 2007 ss impala with the following problems two transmissions both were bad from the shop bad brakes battery needs a mechanic to replace and tire monitoring system is not reliable No wonder Americans buy foreign No more GM cars for me
0,Great vehicle So much fun to drive I recommend upgrading to the sport package for the larger wheel size Makes a big difference in the handling and the looks The run flat tires do start to make noise after a period of time though They can be replaced if you complain about it before the car has reached 10000 miles
1,This vehicle has been trouble from day one Ive been averaging 15 mpg Vehicle is incapable of driving straight three alignments and a new set of tires helped marginally Been running tires around 40 psi 10 above recommended and this seems to help slightly Key fob has been replaced once antenna twice window switch brake pads vehicle has a no start problem rear view mirror vibrates temperature gauge broken clunking in rear suspension reflashed ECM squealing from alternator exhaust rattle and a number of other problems that I cant think of at the moment Ive had the car to multiple dealerships and they only seem to be able to fix the simplest of problems
0,My second 3series BMW after having the thrill of an 05 Viper nothing compares to that beast The 335 is a blast to drive and fun to show off Why spend 20k extra for the new M3 Will do 060 is about 5 seconds with a great engine sound Great interior quality
1,This is my company car and all I have to say is this GM car is junk Fortunately for me I didnt have to pay a penny for this car I have nothing good to say about it and a lot to complain about My biggest complaint is the uncountable number of design flaws For example when you open the trunk on a rainy or snowy day water or snow spills into the trunk compartment The car also has poor handling cheap materials and a build quality that leaves much to be desired Spend your money on a Toyota Honda or Nissan
0,After I saw the show Motorweek that tested the BMW 335 and stated that it went to 060 in 54 seconds I went straight to the dealership to trade in my 325xi I got about every feature on it I purchased one on the lot in Arctic Metallic with grey leather It handles like an M3 its styled as well as the Z8 its as safe as a Volvo and it is as reliable as a Honda This is my fourth BMW and definitely not my last
1,The driving experience is great when the car functions properly Ownership of vehicle is embarrasing because I am often on the side of the road while passerbys yell slanderous remarks because my 07 SS Impala is in the middle of the road dead It is in the dealership as I write this It has had two hard failuresThe mileage on the car is 787 miles
0,this is my third BMW 3 series I truly went with the slogan the ultimate driving machine until now My 328i is sluggish on pick up Once going its jerking me into a whip lash beleive me this is no fun maybe too much technology Once going its Ok
1,The LS is the value here I think you will be dissapointed if you spend more the upper trim levels hey its a Chevy not a Mercedes I found it to have better handling and braking than Ford 500 Handling is even better once I replaced the stockcheap quality tires with the Pirellis that the police package Impala uses Would not have purchased if it didnt have 100k warranty Not all cars on the lot are flex fuel so pay attention Also watch out if buying used used rental car fleets tend to not have ABS or head airbags Had a bad radiator cap that took two visits to diagnose Other than that flawless I have 11k miles on it after 5 months of ownership
0,After years of reading other peoples reviews of their BMWs I finally broke down and got a 335 sedan I can honestly say this is the best car I have ever driven The acceleration is terrific and the steering and braking are phenomenal The interior is gorgeous the Logic 7 system is greatand the gas mileage is pretty good for a car with this horsepower Way to go BMW
1,Vibration and noise thruout car plus tire pressure monitor system gives false reading GM has worked for a year and still has no fix for the Vibnoise problem I was not aware of the problems plus the dealership did not disclose the problems prior to me acceptingpaying for the car
0,This is my first BMW and I love it Waited 10 years for it and it was worth it Handling is great Love the quite interior
1,GM should be embarassed to put the storied Impala name on this fleetgrade rental car Nasty seating Floppy handling and dynamics 1970svintage interior materials and design Hohum styling Spastic tirepressuresensor monitors Fritzy electronics Mediocre power
0,When I decided to buy a car I wanted something classy fun to drive important criteria and for a lack of a better way to describe it had a pedigree behind the performance I looked at all the usuals in the luxury sport sedan class but the BMW 335i left the biggest grin on my face and in the end it was an easy decision for me BMW This car feels faster than the factory specs of 300hp300ftlb and from some reviews it apparently is The surprising thing though so far is that this car is quite good on gas although it does require premium So far city driving has yielded figures of 2527 mpg My last hwy trip was 40 mpg and this was with some spirited driving Highly recommend
1,Had a 2000LS Great car and so I bought a 2007 LTZ The 2007 car is smaller and the back seat has little leg room leather seats are not comfortable back seat sholder belts are ratchet type and close to smallest size and wont relase without releasing the belteverybody that uses these complains there too tight Im getting 16 to 195 MPG which includes 25 percent highway driving and 3 cylinder engine mode Im an easy driver and this is much worse then the 2000 The outside mirrors are smaller and have a bad blind spotbeyond me why they dont incorporate a small wide angle mirror into the rearview and why the insurance companies dont promote this Make sure the car serves your needs
0,Although the Saab and Audi are great cars too the BMW is far better in terms of handling acceleration styling and engine sound
1,I traded in my 2004 Impala SS in for this one and all I can say is Woweee This car rocks Bose stereo 18 rims Gun Metal leather is the best I have ever had The black exterior and the gun metal interior looks great The car looks great overall
0,This car is great I was considering the IS 250 and this car and finally chose this car because it is much more stable to drive at higher speeds Overall this is a great car and worth it for its price
1,window wind noisy loud road noise shifting is not smooth very uncomfortable small things seem to always go wrong
0,This is the seventh BMW I have owned my first one being a 1974 2002 And it is by far the best one The build is rock solid the fit and finish first class and the performance outstanding The most attractive feature of this car aside from its hard top convertible design is its 3 liter twin turbo engine With 300 lb ft of torque available all the way from 1500 to above 5000 rpm this car accelerates like a sling shot While the driving aspects are first class the electronics leave something to be desired The comfort access feature is supposed to allow keyless driving but the Bluetooth does not work properly unless the key is in the slot
1,Car has been serviced regularly at Chevy dealership and tire rotations followed to the teeresult New tires and alignment at 31Kterrible Had steering shaft replaced and air filter box under hood simply fell apartas well as several visits to address Tire Monitor System which does not operate properlyand they cannot seem to fix it so thats bad stuff toobought American why
0,Without a doubt the best automobile I have ever owned Surprising highway mileage and outstanding performance in an all wheel drive vehicle Quality of manufacture is evident in all details
1,I have owned Chevys since 1981 This car has a very poor interior design Esp if you get the front split seat Items fall between the seats all the time The ctr console forces this Suspension problems brake problems and overall poor quality My 2005 Equinox is just as bad No more GM for me
0,Pamper yourself with this car it is worth it A 2007 BMW 328i convertible is the gift that keeps on giving It may not be the most practical vehicle choice but it sure has been the most fun A Mothers Day gift for my wife the thrill and joy of this openair baby just keeps on rewarding her as I have never seen her happier Exceptionally comfortable and luxurious The 30 liter inline six with 230hp is adequate Surprisingly smooth on the road quiet and fuel economical
1,Bought used Already have had new tires alignment brakes steering shaft battery and now the alternator is squealing just past the warranty expiration date The rear end bushings squeak and the seat heaters refuse to work when you sit down in them
0,Just picked up my 328xi a few days ago and I look for any excuse to run errands so I can get behind the wheel I added the sport package cold weather package and the iPod adapter and am pleased with all of my selections This car handles like a dream  it loves to hug the curves and go fast Very tight and responsive and the 6 spd manual is silkysmooth Fit and finish are great The metallic paint is flawless
1,I bought this car for company use in 2006 It is now 2009 and this car has pretty much been replaced The tire monitor system constantly breaks the hot air only works at 1500rpms both fenders have been replaced the tires wore out at 30000 miles the gas gauge reads wrong the paint is bad the fuel tank had to be replaced two injecters went bad My MAF went bad the driver seat ripped the wood trim inside fell off the rear speakers dont work the engine makes alot of noise at idle and shakes bad at idle the RPM gauge is faulty the car idles to high the power seats dont work my rack went bad followed by my power steering pump had tranny problems and a ton more
0,Car handles well performance is amazing braking is great BMW finally got a high end 3 series that really gets up and goes
1,Very disappointed bad paint quality and interior pieces especially the drivers seat continue to fall apart Now just lost both by transmission and torque converter at 74000 miles Guess that is why GM only stands behind their transmissions for 36000 miles It is a very fun car to drive no questions and I routinely get 2628 MPG on highway Tire air pressure monitors are useless and I also have a short in the car no one can find and I keep having dead batteries They cost around  dollar200 if you buy them and install them yourself and you can plan on adding another  dollar50 to have it installed
0,Simply put for me and should be for you this is the best convertible in its class Most fun to drive Gets all the looks has plenty of power and handles like a pure sports car It is stiff but I expected it If you want a soft Lexus type of ride this is not for you I love the ride and feel very confident turning the car at high speeds If you are looking for a sports convertible and you dont test ride this you are making a mistake Its great to build the one you want as well Your options your colors but the option packages can put you in the range of of a 5 or 6 series in price
1,Rear wheels not adjustable for alignment Had tire dealer put adjustments on aftermarket GM would not support this action afterthe fact Heard of police car recall in effect for a similar problem but GM would not standby or admit to failure of virtually same problem on my vehicleThey did not allow under Chevy extended warranty Required new intermediate steering shaft at 57000 miles Drivers door leaks during rain
0,This car is phenomenal It has classleading handling and feel like no other car It has an exceptional 6speed automatic with comfortshift mode sportshift mode and manumatic mode using paddle shifters and rev matching available in all modes to boot who needs a 6 speed manual when this is available And the engine with GOBS of available torque at any RPM propelling this car from 060 in under 5 seconds BMW underrated the power in this car by a mile this as way more than 300hp and 300lbft torque I traded in my 2003 BMW 330i for this car and havent looked back Handsome looks without being a policemagnet I cannot think of a better sports sedan at ANY price
1,I bought this car last summer and have had several problems ever since The tires and its sensors have been going bad since day one Had all sensors and tires replaced At 16K miles the AC compressor went out and busted the drive belt Transmission leaks in the upper seal and gasket which I took care of in my mechanic shop Suspension was replaced on the left side due to a minor accident but its still not the same Im really disappointed with this vehicle Ive wasted a lot of time getting this car in and out of the shop Both my parents have new Chevys and thats all weve owned I guess I just got the bad one in the bunch
0,I was looking for a fun luxury sports sedan and decided to try out the Lexus IS MB CClass and the BMW 3 Series The 335i easily left the biggest grin on my face of the 3 cars I tested and in the end I bought one All I can say is this car is incredible Fast fast fast yet still behaves like a perfect gentleman You better keep both hands on the steering wheel as this car gets up to speed VERY quickly and feels faster than the official numbers BMW states Handles like its on rails and awesome road feel Fuel mileage is great for a car with 300hp City driving so far Im seeing about 2527 mpg and hwy easily over 30mpg unless you drive it hard All around an awesome car
1,I believe the Impala is the best buy in its class for the buck This vehicle has great performance and fuel mileage I average 2021mpg in town with the 39 engine I do not do a lot of highway driving but a friend of mine has a 2008 Impala and he says he gets anywhere from 3134 mpg on the highway with non ethanol gas So far I have had no problems with this car I believe the styling is great and have read there is one more year of this style before a body changeIf you are looking for a full size car I blieve you cannot go wrong with the Chevrolet Impala
0,First BMW and I love it  it is a drivers car  hands on  its so much fun I dont even want to use cruise control
1,Electronic nightmare started with tire monitor system and went downhill from there Dealers dont know how to fix Replaced multiple transmissions Had to sell after 18 months Spent more time in the shop than on the road A little more cash will buy a reliable BMW Dont waste time on the SS
0,In general I would say that I love the car It handles great in curves and high speeds I agreed with the other people saying that if BMW keeps doing cars like this theyll have a customer for life here
1,Traded in a 2004 Impala for my 2007 Loved my 2004 so I figured how could I go wrong Well I was wrong Very disappointed in my 2007 Seats leather are terribly uncomfortable radio reception stinks gas mileage not what I expected My 04 with a 38 V6 got better gas mileage than this 35 V6 does Terrible Down to 22 mpg If I need to pick up speed quickly it hesitates before it decides to go anywhere Not enough storage space for CDs etc Wish Id kept my 04
0,I have had this car for a few months now We have a lot of fun with this BMW I love the way it handles and has plenty of power at the upper rpm range stops on a dime and corners like a dream Like all BMWs the turning radius allows easier parking I love the added shoulder room and the roomier back seat Sport package lowers the car and has bigger tires so you feel the road real well and adds confidence at higher speeds It has a large enough trunk for most Very impressed with this model
1,This is a company car and Ive put 45k on it in 15 months Had problems with tires and they dont seem to keep in balance Lots of car for the money and the gas mileage is excellent for the size of car Six cylinder is peppy and relatively smooth Went from a Lexus to this car but not too bad for the cost of the car
0,This car has it all Keyless entry with convenient access pushbutton start twinturbo One feels the luxury immediately when you sit in the vehicle for the first time I quickly noted the seats were supportive the interiorexterior well designed and myriad numbers of buttons that have some important function strategically placed The next things one notes are twin turbos that propel one from 0 to 60 in around 5 sec Power is a necessity for me This car is like owning a 2 year old 5 series in terms of luxury and beauty I will have to admit some degree of turbo lag The handling is fantastic to be a real wheel drive Brakes are stellar
1,We owned 2005 Impala loved the car No trouble with it Bought a 2007 was told it was a program car later found it was titled to a rental car company Since we bought it we have had it in the shop 3 times for steering The last time they had to replace the gear box and pump It has 35000 miles so is barely under warranty Apparently the steering cannot be fixed Still steers okay sometimes not okay others Intermittently radio has no sound you can turn station selector and change volume control Service dept cant duplicate The heater has also done this but not for the same length of time Gas mileage is horrible and gets worse with each fill up Down to 22 mpg
0,Excellent car and value Turned in my 530i and the 335i is a better car super fast and more fun to drive
1,After riding in many friends Impalas we decided to purchase one The first time we sat in the caruncomfortable seats No headroom for hubby and absolutely no space for passengers in the back seat Trunk can hold an army Side view mirrors are quite small beverage holder poor A low ride Large blind spot Will trade this in soon for another Chevrolet of some type
0,I just bought my 335i coupe and I cant begin to tell you how good this car is at EVERYTHING it does The turbo six pulls like a huge V8 the comfort is fantastic the build quality without peer the styling is polarizing the technology amazing I got her fully loaded to experience all the tech BMW has to offer Previously owned a 2004 E46 330i but this is a whole different kind of animal Once you drive this car it will be extremely hard to consider purchasing anything else I cant believe its a 3series BMW really stepped up to the plate with this one I am amazed how good it is
1,Purchased LT3 with 39 Thought it was a classy car and good value Performance is more than adequate for V6 but mileage is very disapointing Previous car was 03 Impala with 34 which would easily get over 30 mpg on highway with high of 37mpg I have to drive my 07 LT3 carefully to get 2425mpg on the highway I would think that with the technology Chevrolet put into this car  cylinder deactivation and variable valve timing  the 39 engine would do far better Even my old 38 litre cars got better mileage than the 39 engine Road noise and wind noise are also excessive Too bad they couldnt get it right This could have been a great car Sorry but my 2003 Impala was better
0,I previously owned the infiniti G35 and more recently the Lexus GS 300 Traded up in May and purchased the new BMW 335i coupe space grey and coral red interior 6 speed Thank god I did This car puts a smile on my face every time I get into it Not only is it gorgeous I highly recommend the coral red interior the car simply has it all BMW really understands the driving experience and no detail goes unnoticed in the coupe The car is super fast handles like no other car and the build quality is awesome The iDrive bluetooth and navigation are awesome Satellite radio is incredible There are not enough adjectives to describe this car but I will leave you with one PERFECT
1,Weve taken the SS on road trips that include interstate and winding mountain roads The V8 responds immediately and brings back memories of the old Chevy muscle cars Fuel mileage is a little disappointing but its hard not to get on the accelerator when you have the chance
0,Everything about this car is beautiful inside and out as well as the way it drives Just a masterpiece Very classy design and performance that is more than what most people could want Makes point A to point B a fun experience every time
1,I bought this car in a hurry my Nissan pick up quit I liked the styling and after test driving found the Impala to be a blast I bought the base LS No anti lock brakes or fold down seat I knew that going in Buyers need to beware of what they buy I love this car and if it holds up as well as my Lumina did Ill be tickled The 35 v 6 does a good job and being able to burn E85 is good and gas mileage penalty is not too bad
0,I needed a car that had everything Speed agility utility luxury Its got it all The engine has a great sound and it is very calm and quiet at road speed It is everything Ive wanted in a car BMW has a customer for life as long as they keep making cars like this
1,My husband and I absolutely love this car There really are only a few minor complaints the sunvisors have a poor design the cruise doesnt hold as well as I would like and the road noise is more than in other similar models Otherwise this is a great engine with lots of torque the fuel mileage with the VVT can get up to 33mpg on the highway with the wind at your back30 otherwise and the interior is very comfortable The lumbar support is fantastic We made a long road trip this past Christmas and I am pregnant and I did not get back pain at all The fold down back seats were great for transporting stuff Oh and my husband loves the remote start in the cold weather
0,This was my first BMW purchase I must say I have never driven a car that was so much FUN to drive It handles like a dream The car is absolutely beautiful I would definitely recommend it
1,I waited to write this after owning the Impala for 1 year I have not been at the dealer since as I have had not one single problem It has great power and is fun to drive Lacking rear room and front seats are not as comfortable as other cars All in all a good car
0,I have the sport package with a manual transmission Love the car It has a perfect balance of performance and utility Enough room to carry 4 people and luggage for a long weekend or to do some track days and autocross Just keep in mind that while it has great power and decent handling it is not a true sports car On the track and autocross lighter cars that handle better catch it in corners Not to say you cant have fun there but it isnt a truly dedicated track machine The car really shines on long road trips Quiet and will cruise at super legal speeds all day Also has enough power to pass in 6th or climbs hills
1,I bought this car for the economy after owing an SUV gas guzzler I was not disappointed Gets between 25 and 32 mpg I have a shake in the car though that the dealer has not been able to get out after 5 visits and two new sets of tires Love the car but hate the shake seems like a quality control issue
0,I traded in my 2004 325i for the 335i sedan It has the same if not better drive and handling as my 325i However the twin turbo engine is amazingly fast with abundant torque right off the line It is a very exciting drive I also think the interior materials are a step up from the E46 model also very nice with additional amenities such as Bluetooth and satellite radio Very well done and worth the difference in cost from 328 if you can swing it
1,I have had a 60 64SS 71 77 89 95 and now an 07 Impala I have it 10 months now and I have to say Im impressed Sufficient power comfortable front seats road driving 32 In town 26 average Actually quieter than my 03 Mercury Marquis Probably the best mileage car I have ever owned By the way I have a contact in Oshawa Canada where these are made and I am told the Impala quality control is strict and tight with constant inspections Its not Grandpas old big monster Impalas but I am rolling with the times and this looks like a winner
0,I stare at this car all the time even in my garage White premium sport paddles and heated seats Fast fast fast 130 mph not a problem dont suggest doing it though Love the low rumble of the dual exhaust pipes suspension is tight and xenons are bright Ive always wanted an M3 still do but best bang for your dollar
1,Great powersurprised me when I had to use it 21mpg w ac 2630 wo A little too much noise for me interior at 60mph but then depends on roadway why whine huh but great traction room for 3 in backseat but a little cramped for 6 ft tall peopletrunk not squared at backseat junction Never used OnStar so far so dunno if I need it yet Controls well positioned easy to operate Have about 8K miles on it so far with only oil change and tire rotationno other problems When I go to dealership always look in repair lot to 07 Impalas very little there and customers I talk to are pleased w their Impalas When I reach 15K miles will write another review
0,This car has way more power than we are given in the specifications I blew away a Porsche Carrera on three seperate runs and I know the torque was the deciding factor I drive this car everyday and it handles like an everyday car When the time comes for performance it never hesitates This is probably the best car I have ever owned WHAT A RIDE
1,I looked at lots of cars before chosing the Impala Hondas and Toyotas dont stack up in the quality and solid feel when you close the doors Auto insurance is also lower than buying foreign I checked with insurance companies to help decide which car was the least expensive to own
0,The perfomance is as expected very good The reviews in the mags are correct it is a fast car High marks for style and perfomance  fuel consumption is what you should expect from a car like this  its a true sports sedan Get the sports package well worth it
1,I bought my 2007 Malibu LTZ in September 2009 with 22100 miles Very clean and sporty Stereo system sounds great Only problem is when Im driving on the highway an annoying rattle comes and goes under the dashboard Sounds like a leaf stuck in the vent but its not It sounds like it is coming from the heatingcooling system I noticed many others had same complaints of an annoying rattle under the dashboard
0,Before purchasing the BMW 328i coupe with the sports package I had an Audi A4 which is also suppose to have great handling performance etc Hands down  no comparison I have never had as much fun driving a car as I do with the BMW Granted its pricey doesnt come with as many features my 4 yr old audi had way more features and was less expensive but in terms of performance man this car certainly is the ultimate driving machine Extremely quick on takeoff suspension is phenomenal and braking is incredible Not to mention its styled so elegantly that you will certainly get looks on the road Amazing car by far the most fun I have ever had driving a car
1,I havent enjoyed driving this car very much at all The steering wheel is very large and hard to turn sharply The acceleration is poor and when going up even the slightest hill it loses at least 10 miles per hour The interior is well made and comfortable except for the material that covers the seats I havent had any mechanical problems but there is a constant rattle after you hit 45mph and it wont stop The outside is very plain and doesnt appeal to the eye It just isnt that great of a car
0,I just traded in my 2002 BMW M coupe for this 335i convertible and was a little skeptical about making such a huge change at first When I first picked up the car I spent the whole day driving it and what a ride I was completely blown away with the comfort power handling and sheer beauty of this vehicle The attention to detail is fantastic and I kept finding little things that would shock me with excitement The engine sound is completely unlike any BMW Ive ever driven  and Ive driven a lot It sounds really exotic and has a subtle but aggressive growl that thrills when you put your foot down I thought I would really miss my M coupe but I honestly havent thought about it at all
1,I was recently in a car accident do to steering wheel locking up and being unable to steer car Front axle broke and A arm broke GM sent out an inspector which they determined the reason this happened was that I had hit a curb and that is why it happened I refuse to believe that and am very unhappy with there answer I cant believe that such a reputable company has let me down I also cant believe that they told me that this problem had never been reported when in fact I have found many complaints on the internet about the same thing I really do not feel comfortable in this car anymore and will never purchase any vehicle from GM I really think they need to look into this and recall cars
0,Fabulous performance and great fun to drive But the quirky automatic transmission and seat belt server are annoying Now a persistent fuel pressure problem from either the ECM or the high pressure fuel pump has the car at the shop for over three weeks I miss my 2002 911 C2 I should have kept it at the end of its lease
1,I only have 4000 miles on my Malibu car and I have an anti theft malfunction The car just dies on you and you have to have it towed to the dealership each time it happens GMC has not offered a recall on this problem and there are hundreds of complaints online about the same problem Im not happy with it because of this problem and also because once youre on the freeway you cant have the windows open as you can with Fords and other cars The car starts vibrating and making an awful sound so you have to shut the windows This was a very costly experience and I regret changing from 40 years with Ford
0,This was the best move I have ever made I went for a SUV to this 328i BMW This car is amazing hold the road like no other Gas mileage is the best Cut my monthly gas bill in half With the price of gas that is saving me around 150 per month
1,This company car is poorly designedDoor hinges cheap front end replaced in 3800 miles as was the ac compressor rotors and wiper mechanism There is a flutter in the ac vent that no one can explain and is noisy Others with our company have similiar problems so this is not a one caro thing Also pwer steering problems with some
0,I love the car handling and power are great Very quiet
1,This car handles great and gets 32 mpg hwy with a 35 engine I like the European look especially in the silver color Also has sunroof and spoiler Great price compared to others in its class About 4000 less than book because it was a buy back The electric power steering motor had to be replaced right off the bat but it was done quickly and there has been no trouble since My wife and I took on a steep and winding country road when trying it out and we were hooked
0,I traded in a 2003 infinity G35 CoupeI thought this car exceeded expectations but the BMW outclassed this car in every fieldYes the sticker price was 6 thousand dollars more but worth every penny
1,I have only had my vehicle for about 2 weeks but I love it I am a little disappointed that it does not have the tracking feature as the other Malibus have had But I am looking forward to a long and happy time with this car
0,Having owned BMWs previously I expected an excellent car however the 3 series blew me away with its road feel handling and poise versus anything else in its class or anywhere near it Yes I drove many others and some in this class cost less money but you get what you pay for and this BMW is head and shoulders better in ride quality handling and quietness
1,I purchased this car used from a dealership with 32k miles on it I also own a 2005 Malibu sedan I immediately noticed a clunking sound coming from the steering column when turning the wheel at low speeds This is a sound I also noticed in my 2005 Malibu I took it back to the dealer and they had to lubricate the intermediate shaft in the steering column The shades to the sunroof also broke so they ordered new ones for me as well The car is comfortable rides well and has good acceleration with the 35 liter V6 I dont understand how some people here are getting 29 mpg however because I am getting about 18 mpg in mostly city driving Disappointing mileage
0,Test drove the A4 G35 IS 250 Had to buy a golf bag   and saw a BMW dealership on the way Already had a deal on the Lex but was not comfortable wthe back seat space Pulled in and walked out wthe 328i Excellent performance I drive a ridiculous  of miles and feel great with the ride and amenities Response of engine is excellent comfort exceptional The layout of cabin is perfect for those of us who do not needwant to be bombarded by buttons bells and whistles you will find all you need win arms length no clutter You definitely get to drive this car and not just ride in it Recom anyone look at this car it was the last one I looked at and the one I chose it will make an impression
1,I fell for this car when I found it in the used section of the dealership over a year ago The XM radio the wood trim although its fake the zippy way it drives the dvd player the two sun roofs all so neat But the Maxx has been plagued with problems  mainly electrical And I have been driving for 10 years with no problems with blowing out the tires but I have gone through 4 different tires on this car apparently due to my driving I was driving trucks before Im not sure that I would buy this car again I think I would go for a Honda or Toyota sorry Detorit
0,Just got the car 3 days ago and man is it awesome Went to the dealership to get M3 info walked out with the 335i coupe Traded my 07 vette for it and I dont regret it one bit Its not quite as fast but it drives much better It handles well the interior is rich and comfortable with options galore Its like the current M3 in performance with a smoother more quiet ride Perfect for me The new M3 surely will be my next car if I can get one in the next 2 yrs I still need to get used to the iDrive and all the features it comes with Real time traffic will be useful
1,Owned this car for over a year now I had test driven the LS but the LTZ is a class above I agreed with Edmunds bland interior for the LS but found the LTZ felt totally different The leather wrapped steering felt much more comfortable and the rest of interior did not feel cheap Same with the wheels etc I never read the manual much so I keep finding new things in the car When cleaning I found the audio volume control on the steering on the underside of other audio buttons Recently I found out I could do tapshift I could not figure how to operate the  buttons earlier till I put the car in L coming downhill  it was so much fun
0,Its our first German made car and we were thrilled with it Its the real thing and not going back to Japanese made car again Comes with sports package and navigation system 18 inch wheel and run flat tires makes it sportier Feeling cloud 9 once you are driving it The acceleration and the brakes are very impressive Its one of the fastest and the sexiest cars ever made Its driving me crazy and wish Im in it 247
1,I replaced a 2004 Maxx with this 2007 Maxx SS I was and am totally satisfied with the car Finally a great eyeappealing sport sedan from GM and Chevy decides not to build this model for the 2008 Lineup To limit production of this model to 3 years is questionable
0,The performance and overall handling of my 335i tops everything Ive ever owned The broad torque band gives terrific power at most any speed and the car is incredibly nimble and easy to maneuver whether in town or on the highway The car inspires confidence in the driver The fit and finish are superb
1,After driving foreign built vehicles for the last 18 years I came across this car at  dollar3000 below blue book and bought it Had I bothered to check that this garbage can had depreciated  dollar15000 in 3 years I would have passed But alas I didnt and now I have the pleasure of fixing all the KNOWN GM design problems in the steering column brake rotors steering rack and struts I have had 1960 era cars with better steering and suspension systems Of course because GMC is an American company it is based on greed and not customer care they refuse to fixrecall any of these problems because not enough people have died in the car I look forward to the day when I can unload this lemon
0,This is my dream car My last 3 cars have all been from Mercedes and after owning this just a few hours now I am wondering why I did not jump ship faster The gearbox is state of the art and shifts are fast and smooth The car corners flat and little or no hint of body roll on the high speed sweepers even under braking I bought the car with every option but iDrive because I like the simplicity of the cabin without it Edmunds shows the 2007 Corvette 060 at 523 seconds I am looking forward to the day I meet one at a light
1,First off the auto press nitpicking about the steering gruff engine and interior simply are not true The electric steering is just fine it adjusts to vehicle speed and there is all the feedback of a hydraulic unit I notice no difference and I have driven a lot of cars in my life As for the engine its just as quiet and smooth as the V6 in my moms Lexus RX300 The interior well on the LT its cloth not leather but its just as swank as my work mates Accord LX  its workaday no doubt but for a midline interior its got what the others do This car also handles and brakes very well too Dont let the press fool you  this car is every bit the equal of its Japanese competition
0,Initially I was not a BMW fan I was a long time MB user BMWs slogan the ultimate driving machine meant nothing to me Until I drove one Ive always heard that BMWs drive like nothing else This is very true I have never felt more intune with a vehicle before The responsive and agile handling of the car is excellent As with most german cars fit finish and quality is at its best The car feels so solid and refined Every component of the car fits together perfectly Interior is gorgeous and sporty very driver oriented Mercedes Benz is unmatched in luxury and refinement But BMWs driving dynamics are superb If you want the car to drive you get an MB yet if youre a driver only BMW
1,The greatest thing about this car is blowing by cars that are modded to race Most dont stand a chance with the hp and torque on this thing Only one problem with it is that if you drive in salt a lot your rotors rust easily mine after 27k miles but dealer handles that as long as you dont void your warranty Up to 34 mpg going 60 mph Headturner no matter where you are Not to mention the stock 18s look sweet
0,This car is lots of fun acceleration and handling is awesome However I had some overheating problem due to a malfunctioning water pump after 4800 miles The car shut down the engine in the middle of the highway The dealer replaced the water pump let hope it not going to happen again
1,Purchased new my second Monte Carlo The first one is a 2000LS This 07 LT is garbage Problems from bad DIC few of them display burns out replaced all four rims from corrosion already car creaks like a 10yr old car cheaper plastics and low grade leather seating Maybe they skimped on quality for the last year Really thought Id love this one the way I love my old Monte which I still have
0,I took ownership on 21407 and you can say it was love at first drive The handling is the best of any car I have owned or driven
1,What a disappointment Cant believe I had to replace the steering shaft twice at 700 miles and again at 7800 What was my dream car became my nightmare Gas mileage is terrible and the stereo reception and speakers are just as bad
0,It is a great car if you have a family with kids but still want some adrenaline rush I had SLK320 before but 335i beats SLK hands down in driving pleasure and comfort Love the steering wheel paddle shifters makes manual semi drive truly a wonderful experience
1,Well Ive owned this car for four months and really enjoy it Gas mileage using regular gas is great 27 cityhighway I get 34 on the highway Since this car is a Flex Fuel car I started using E85 and the mileage dropped like 68 miles to the gallon which was very disappointing otherwise this car is great
0,Just purchased my 07 335i Sedan Sports package with automatic tranny The paddle shifters are too much fun Reminds me of playing racing games in the arcade only that you crash and die if you mess up with this car Incredibly fast and excellent handling The car seems to drive so effortlessly but at incredible speeds Its a keeper
1,I have been a long GM supporter starting back in the 70s with SS Chevelles Z28s Impala SS and Monte Carlos I have also owned many cars from the competition and acurrently own a 2007 Accord V6 Hybrid With that said when its time to take a cruise the Monte SS usually leaves the garage first I am not a big supported of front wheeled cars but Chevy certainly makes this car feel light to handle while being agressively quick such as a performance car should The 53 engine is perfect for this size car with a exhaust note that can only come out of a big V8 Also on the mileage side I average about 2326MPG with mixed driving Not bad for a 300HP car Sorry Hondathe wife still loves you
0,Great car Tight and powerful Rides like a race car yet is very civil if driven easy Has very good mileage and the fit and finish is excellent The cabin is well equipped any has many features such as DTS
1,I have been leasing a Chevy Monte Carlo for 8 years I have yet to have had any trouble with the car The only service I have to do is to change the oil What better car can there be then this car
0,This car is so much fun to drive Its amazingly comfortable equipped with the sport package seats iDrive is easy to use after a brief learning curve voice commands are awesome keyless go is tremendous and the handling and acceleration is superb Outside of that I hate the car
1,Ive had 5 battery failures The dealer and apparently GM cannot locate the cause Had to have it towed once Also cannot get enough heat in the cabin when driving in cold weather The dealer looked at this issue twice and found no problem No more General Motors vehicles for me Two days ago I traded this unreliable truck for a 2010 Tundra
0,Ive had this car for about 4 months now i already have 12000 miles FUN to drive AMAAAZING speed real time information is great The cup holder is the only annoying thing otherwise its the perfect car
1,Have NO problems with this truck except for one Goodyear tires it came with OEM are a death threat to who ever is in the truck when ground is wet I would like to see the CEO of goodyear drive with them on wet ground STAY AWAY from these tires change them ASAP if you have them I put General Grabbers on 200 percent better
0,Drove the IS 350 then the 07 G35S The I drove the 335i bought the car I test drove This is our 4th BMW Unbelievable the power this thing is delivering Thanks to the steptronic the ride can be cruizy even docile then go to shockingly fast with the help of the paddle shifters hence perfect car for my wife and me Wonderful feel in the corners Only the G35 came close Apparently easily tuneable Im not sure if I could handle any more Sports package a must the 18 rims have a great look and the sports seats create an impeccably snug fit A quick read of the owners manual reveals laundry list of incredible safety and performance features I am unbelievably happy with my purchase
1,After owning several GM products the latest generation is nothing short of amazing I went from a 97 GMC pickup to a 2003 Tahoe and am now driving a 2007 Silverado Crew Cab Max package I highly recommend them I have pulled boats from 30ft down fully loaded dump trailers and the like with the truck with only the addition of a set of rear airbags and a trailer brake controller This is absolutely the best vehicle I have ever had to workplay with on the weekend and commute with during the week I was extremely skeptical of the estimated 19 MPG highway after owning the rig for over 2 years and 65000 miles I dont find it far off I usually have a combined fuel average of 155 at fill up
0,My wife and I recently traded in my 2003 C5 Corvette for a 2007 BMW 335i coupe and we have no regrets so far I was in love with my Corvette and did not want to get rid of it but with a baby on the way we needed a car with more space I was never a fan of BMW cars I always thought they were overpriced and highly over rated until I took one for a test drive Wow now I understand what all the hype is about Ive had my car for about a month now and it is simply amazing The acceleration is actually better than my Corvette The lowend torque from the turbos makes the car fly off the line and feel quicker than it really is The handling is great and this car loves to be tossed around corners
1,highway driving causes 3rd gear failure at 35K miles AC makes noise at auto setting and has been replaced once Ongoing problems Thank god for the GM warranty Rear drink holders are fisherprice like Other than that  interior is pretty good comfortable exterior looks like a truck should XM is great No blue tooth is crazy but they fixed in later years Cant understand why GM wouldnt spend the extra  dollar50 and make wheel well inserts standard Plastic door inserts look like miniature lego pieces ie cheap as hell Used to own a Tundra and went domestic to try and help local business but may rethink next time is I keep having problems At 40000 miles now
0,We purchased our US Spec 335i coupe with all available options I have had it on the autobahn and tested the speed limiter which is in fact at 155mph I can run a Porsche 911 at least until they hit the 165 mph mark and keep going what limiter otherwise we would spank the entry level 911 This car is faster than the advertised 060 in 53 My guess is more like 45 I dread the day we take it to the states but I will save my money for speeding tickets starting now I guess This is the most fantastic car I have ever driven The new upcoming M3 maybe M5 is next for us
1,74000 kms and the transmission wont shift gears I dont tow I do not beat on it I take very good care of it and this is how I am repaid GM needs to put alot more thought into building a reliable truck My last 2002 silverado was just as big a lemon And to think I would give Chevy one more chance I cant wait to see how much this one is going to cost Im sure GM will try to get out of the so called warranty
0,Just the right size for the city but plenty of room for extra loads for the weekend house I love the stelthy look also of the wagon way under the radar of sportier looking cars Runs to the home store on weekends with large objects are no problem The keyless option is an absolute must Put the key in your pocket and forget it oh and dont forget the heated seats This is My first BMW in a long time and I had forgotton just how incredible the steering is however Im still trying to get used to the very sensitive brakes My old 2005 Saab 93 had much better pedal feel
1,I love this truck so far and have attempted to give a fair review I love the styling Cadillaclike LTZ interior The truck rides great and on the highway I regularly get over 21mpg and average almost 17mpg overall I love the look of the truck and have consistently received compliments I went for the 20 wheels too and would recommend that option to anyone who would not regularly take the truck offroad as it really fills up the wells which is a complaint I have seen several times I am worried about a recent dead battery I went to start the truck in the morning sat for 10 hours and it was dead There wasnt not even a click gauge movement or dim lights
0,I bought my 328i ManualSports Package in October 2006 and Im very happy Its not a car for snow weather but as soon as the streets are dry it is so much fun to drive this coupe
1,Recently purchased 1LT Ext Cab This truck drives like a Cadillac Great ride absolutely blows away new Toyota Tundra Even with small V8 good accelaration and sounds great 100K powertrain great selling point standard OnStar new black tie audio radio even in 1LT sounds good and great display on stored radio stations Would highly recommend to anyone
0,As this was my first BMW I was very excited about getting behind the wheel Until I finally got behind the wheel then I found out what real excitement is all about What an amazing vehicle I love every aspect of it Its acceleration turning and braking are all beyond my expectations I drive into Manhattan everyday and I still get about 25 mpg The sound system is wonderful and the bluetooth works well with it It will be hard not to always have a BMW in my garage
1,The truck does not get 16 and 20 mpg as stated  This fuel management engine is worse than my last Chevy The truck makes a grinding or rubbing noise at between 40 and 45mph GM says this is a exhaust noise Dealership says they can muffle the noise a little Paid  dollar35 grand to listen to a noisy exhaust Very disappointed in the truck fales advertisement by GM on the gas mileage Will purchase a Honda next time
0,The funnest safest and biggest smile any car has given me Handles turns at ninety that most cars can handle at only fifty And feels like fifty instead of ninety The head lights that follow the curves and the cockpit lighting that enhances rather than distracts are absolutely smart and aesthetically pleasing
1,This truck is hands down the best on the market for the money Compared to the rest Toyota is the only one that comes close but the price difference holds me back Now with the 100k powertrain warranty Ill have it paid off before the warranty is gone
0,This is my first BMW had I known it was this good I would have gotten one a long time ago Test drove many others in its class but this car is head and shoulders above the rest The others although very well constructed and outfitted were like riding on a comfy couch going down the highway the BMW you DRIVE Ride handling acceleration all perfectly melded into truly an Ultimate Driving Machine This car is almost too much fun to drive Hopefully it will not be too hazardous to my driving record
1,My 2007 Silverado Z71 4x4 has a good ride it pulls a little to left has wind noise in upper drivers side door seal and is getting 147 mpg on the highway I have the 53 iron block with the fuel saving 48 cyl 8 cyl on demand Was told if any aftermarket parts were installed to help mpg it would void the powertrain warranty Break in point was between 35000 miles Also when braking hard you have to use force to manuver around an object to overcome computer
0,Ive owned 4 3series in 3 different countries Traded in my 01 330ci which I owned longer than any other because it was so perfect The 335i coupe is even better looking even more powerful even more comfortable Only niggle is interaction between the turbo charged engine and automanual transmission I drive almost exclusively in manual mode because the shift points dont seem to work for me in regular automatic Run flat tires are also harsher than the Pilot Sports on my 330ci  BUT the suspension is better which compensates
1,This is by far the best truck on the market Better value than F150 and better quality than the Ram I never looked at Tundra because Ill never buy a foreign truck Only the American brands know how to build a real truck and GM showed everyone they knew what they were doing It has the best fuel economy while still having the highest payload Buy this you wont regret it
0,I have had this car for a month now Its so fun to drive Say goodbye to sluggish acceleration With the new automatic transmission and sport package youll get an awesome handling during acceleration and during sharp cornering Its been a joy for me to drive this baby I can never get tired with it I was going to buy the 335i but the salesperson told me that 328i was good enough for California Highway so I didnt get the 335i The only downturn is that if you drive your car through local road and traffic all the time it can only give you 1517 mpg Hey I cant complain
1,Purchased my MAX last week which is not even listed as a choice to make a review Absolutely insane to drive Never have felt more power in a Chevy since the Typhoon days Interior is of highest quality regardless of what anyone says Ford and Dodge owners will be very jealous and the Japanese cannot touch them The Max roars with power and probably wont even need an exhaust system as it already sounds great Looking forward to my bed managent system but my dealer has yet to receive any accessories from the factory yet
0,Ive had many cars in the past including AMG cars and this 3 series is the best combination of performance and comfort by far It handles like a slot car pulls like an M3 and is just as comfortable as any car in its class The interior is top notch and its plenty roomy for this size car
1,Interior fit and finish is poor The plastic rattles and makes cracking noises Wind noises in town and on the highway The seats make cardboard noise when sat in The doors rattle and the radio sounds cheap 48 autotrack is a great power train Gas mileage is average Factory tires could be updated
0,The overall ownership experience is like none before Ride and drive styling feature and functionality complimentary maintenance safety rating and resale value add up to the best value ever in 20 years of vehicle ownership Dont miss this spectacular  in fact superior rated vehicle
1,The best Silverado yet However the rear bumper absolutely stinks I backed into a snow bank  dollar2000 damage Also when it is below zero the switch to change from 4WD to 2WD doesnt work and vice versa When cold out I cannot get enough heat while on the road
0,I just took delivery of the coupe I built two days ago I have enjoyed learning the iDrive controls etc although it can be a little bit frustrating at first The engine drives and sounds exactly like what I expected from the Ultimate Driving Machine I drove in sleet and ice last night and it felt like I was on a dry road I am very happy I chose this vehicle over the G35 CLK and IS 250s that I test drove it seems that nothing could compare
1,Truck has been good to me Only problems have been a battery replacement which was a GM recall and my tonneau cover created some paint problems on the bed rails I recommend buying some plastic bed rails or taking the cover off regularly to make sure water is not getting trapped Over very satisfied with the truck
0,I just bought this car yesterday and as you can guess Im writing a review today to tell about how great the car is The performance on the vehicle is jaw dropping the exterior styling is perfect and the technology on the vehicle is one the industry leaders The bluetooth technology and voice command system are among the coolest features of the car The idrive is a bit complicated but I feel confident after a bit of use it will become second nature Did I mention I love the 300 horses under the hood Highly recommend
1,Got rid of it It got the worst gas mileage of any of the Silverados I have owned Never got anything more than 15 even on the highway It was a 4x4 Z71 and rode terrible Did like the way it handled though So happy to see it go
0,My 6 speed 335i ZSP sedan was purchased used as a CPO The powers nice the fairly sharp handling is rewarding nice to be back in RWD and the is quite cocooned Large trunk decent gas mileage and large backseat make it a good family car wife and infant son I look forward to curves Sadly the vehicle is extremely heavy the RFTs are lousy and the interior trim appears to be peeling away on the door handle and steering wheel Its a fun enough car but I look forward to the day I wont need something so large Im anxious for BMW to produce a light RWD coupesedan For the next few years the 335i will suffice
1,Love the truck but the gas tank is empty most of the time I have 373 gears for pulling boats and heavy loads and the best mpg on the highway at 55 is 159 Not 20 mpg
0,Fun to drive however interior and wiring stinks Driver Side Door cup has peeled twice Replaced nearly half of the exterior light bulbs on the car I have the Steptronic Transmission and my car STALLED TWICE at a stop Car has only 20K miles
1,I have owned this truck a little over a year and currently have 11000 miles on it Prior to purchasing I test drove the F150 Tundra and Ridgeline before making my decision Hands down the Silverado had the nicest interior ride and more than adequate power Ive towed my 5300 camper with it 3 times and have been very impressed with the pulling power of the 53 averaging pullng 13 MPG which isnt bad considering the trailer is like pulling a parachute Thrilled I made this choice and the truck continues to inspire me that America can still make a great vehicle
0,Just bought this car 10 days ago and chose it over a 2006 Corvette LT3 convertible Styling is conservatively aggressive and should be appealing for a long time Engine is really strong and Im enjoying using the paddle shifters Highest quality interior of any 3 Ive ever had and this is my fifth one More technology in this car than I will ever use but its fun to have it Hard to believe but this car listed for over  dollar60K and I got it for approximately twothirds of that My first service experience was pleasant and Im a big fan of BMWs comprehensive service for the first four years or 50000 miles
1,Great truck Have the 53L with 342 rear end and tow pkg Window sticker said 21 mpg hwy 16 mpg city and thats what Ive been getting But thats if doing the speed limit Averaging 186 mpg over the 11000 miles Worst mpg was 149 this winter Got 16 mpg when towing tandem axle trailer 55 mph max speed on a 400mile round trip loaded with upright piano furniture and empty trailer on the way back Plenty of power for towing and normal driving
0,Absolutely the best car I have ever owned Handles as you would expect for a BMWlike a sports car but also with the luxury you would expect from BMW This car is FASTvery FAST One must be very careful driving because you can get to 100mph in a heartbeat and it only feels like youre doing 40mph For a 300hp engine gets great gas mileage at posted highway speeds 65mph of somewhere around 2930mpg Expect 2324 mpg in combined highwaycity driving After 14000 miles and 16 months of driving I have had zero issues requiring any maintenance by the dealership They did change the oil at one year 11K miles and the wiper blades but the car has needed no other attention
1,I had a Tundra before so I got used to the Japanese fine finish This truck interior is falling apart and it only has 5000 miles The 4x4 electronic switch is very unreliable More often than not it doesnt disengage the 4x4 even though it shows 2x2 Fuel efficiency is the worse Visibility is horrible Big hood for no reason at all just to look tough Engine lifters make a horrible sound 3 out of 5 times when starting the truck in the morning
0,At first I was a little skeptical about purchasing a BMW as many reviews including consumer reports stated that the electronics fail often and overall reliability is not as high as other Japanese companies However when I read about the 335 twin turbo engine I had to take a test drive My first car was a 20015 18T Audi with a chip and exhaust Loved the Audi but once I had 150K miles I sold it and got an Acura I pledged never to get another nonAWD car again The Acura was plain boring Once I drove the 335xi it was obvious that this was a special car I bought it the same day and traded in my Acura TL
1,This truck has 18 wheels and the ride is horrible my 2003 rode much better and the improvment in ride is where What happened to the lights on the doors Nowhere to be found I have an LTZ and the seats heaters are not designed properly for the seats The sides of the seats do not heat and the leather is cold because of this When spending this kind of money  dollar37000 I would have expected a much improved truck just didnt get it I dont like the dome lamps and cargo lamps on the same switch Next time I trade Ill be looking at other makes
0,Sadly I had to get rid of my new coupe when I moved to Manhattan This was my second newly leased 3 Series and I loved it The interior just improved on its predecessor but perhaps the drive of the car was a slightly looser lower and heavier than my 2003 sedan But so much fun I had a 6speed manual and just loved pushing this car The interior defined luxury for me I understand editors obsessions with buttons but the eccentric simplistic design of this car is one of its best assets That and rearwheel drive and of course everything always worked
1,This is the first GM vehicle that I have owned where I have not had to bring it back to the dealer to get anything fixed I have over 12K miles in less than 6 months of driving averaging 18 mpg The air conditioning is powerful and cold My only complaint is there is too much badging of the vehicle After removing all of the silly 4x4 stickers huge Chevy Bowtie Silverado and GM badging I can now appreciate the quality of the paint on my truck
0,Euro delivery was seamless Munich plates intact 8 weeks later  stateside pickup Super 28 mpg fuel avg after 1000 K Whats not to like The accelerator pedal is touchy however by softly rolling your right foot clockwise against the pedal and the center console you can ease the contact and avoid pinning your passengers and swallowing your dentures The drivers armrest swoops downward gracefully only to annoy the left knee This gripe is solved by lowering the drivers seat a bit for the cars beltline is such you dont feel like you are in a well Truly the Ultimate Driving Machine Those bemoaning the BMW cupsize cupholders Please refrain from chugalugging Mellow Yellow while at the wheel of a 335i Thats too too RISKY
1,Have had my 2007 silverado for about 1 month now and have had nothing but problems the ac has went out on it the tire pressure monitoring system has had to be fixed already and the is some type of popping noise in the rearend when you start up a hill and the truck switches in to second gear This truck is the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned and will never own another
0,Wife made me trade my GTO in I was worried about finding a car that had good HP and was 4 doors Well wow I found that car Car is great I have driven stick for many years The automatic with the DS mode is really fun It took me 3 months to find a car If you can afford this car buy it
1,I previously owned a 2003 Chevy Silverado and traded it in for an 07 Texas edition I have to say that Chevy finally did it They made a great truck The little things count Very impressed with the new interior design More room in the cab Its like a cross between a Caddy and truck Very nice
0,I have passed 1000 miles on my new 3 series I am very happy with the manueverability accuracy and responsiveness of the car to pedal and brake The seat heating is quite fast making it useful for this season I loved the 335 too but it did not have an AWD version
1,The truck has over 30000 miles on it and has not had any warranty repairs No rattles squeaks or wind noise Nothing This is the first time I have bought a new vehicle and not had a few problems
0,Ive owned this car Xenons Premium   and Winter Pkgs for a month and have been very pleased The driving dynamics are superb but why repeat what every publication has already said From the outside the car appears small but from the drivers seat the feel is quite substantial The car feels as solid as a rock at all speeds Theres plenty of room up front Im 6 ft 200 lbs and the car fits me with ample room to spare The front seats nonsport are as comfortable   and supportive as any Ive ever sat in The drivers relationship to all the controls is excellent and outward visibility is great in all directions The adaptive Xenon headlights are fantastic The car is quick but not a speed racer
1,Truck is OK ride is good Im getting 129 mpg in town   and 17 on highway at 75 mph AC just started marking a knocking sound blows cold but is very noisy
0,We replaced our 2004 BMW 330 Ci 6speed with the 335i 6speed These two autos have almost nothing in common Everything that we liked about our 04 has been improved on with the 335i The 335i handles even better and the acceleration must be experienced to be believed It reminds me more of a Z4 than a coupe The mileage isnt as good as our older car but that is to be expected and the tradeoff is more than worth it One more thing it looks so much sportier yet classy They got this one right
1,I live in the South Burbs of Chicago I cant explain how great this truck drives Its been 3 weeks and had put 2500 miles on it I enjoy driving in this great Chevy This is my first American truck and cant get enought of it First of all the ride is perfect the layout of the cabin is what the doctor ordered and the power of this truck leaves others in your rear view mirrors Havent hauled anything heavy yet dont think Ill have any problems Chevy is loaded up with all the goodies except the Navi I installed an aftermarket Have the LTZ package with 20s leather bed hook system STB system Head Curtains Back Up Sensors with lots of Chrome I Just Luv it
0,This is the most wonderful driving expeirence I have ever had I have had this car for almost 2 weeks and I just love to drive it It handles like you would not believe and looks good doing it My husband brought it as a Christmas gift and had driven it more than me We are having a ball Thanks BMW I think that we will stay in the family
1,Forget the 16mpg city   and 22 mpg highway they say I would get I get 123 city 125 highway Without the air on add 1 mpg If I wanted a car I would have bought one No cigarette lighter but has a vanity mirror on the driver side Guys dont use a vanity mirror we use the rear view Im back driving my 88 GMC 34 ton extended cab 8 bed 350  get 20 mpg Need to put out a step stool for some passengers to get in Sits way to high making it hard to get my tools out of the bed Poor visabality right front fender wiper in the way I liked my 2003 1500 Chevy much better
0,Went to Germany to pick up my new 335i and drove it on the autobahn The handling was great 060 about 5 sec and the key thing is the steptronic system Best investment
1,I bought this truck when they first hit the streets its a black Z71 LTZ with a black front end chrome mesh grille assist steps and other than the gas mileage its the best truck Ive ever owned I tow my boat with it all the time and can barely tell Im pulling anything Chevy has come a long way with this one I hope they keep up the good work in the future
0,A lot of people have and will talk about the 328335 coupes superb driving performance on solid pavement I certainly concur with that I want to comment on the 328xis also superb winter performance It is hard to believe that a sports sedan can be so much fun and perform so safely in such adverse conditions It is simply fun to drive all the time The only thing that holds it back is the depth of the snow because of the low ground clearance Otherwise it tracks through curves solidly in slush and snow stops on slippery surfaces as well as any car could be expected to and just gives you a feeling of confidence You dont have to give up a sporty BMW just because of the weather
1,Traded my 05 Chevy crew cab got 17mpg Now I only get 14mpg mostly hwy with new truck Ac vent makes weird noise Stiffer ride than my 05 does not have rear ac vents like my 05 turning radius is too wide Does have nice features like side curtain airbags parking assist nice looking truck but been very disappointed so far compared with my 05 crew cab
0,Ordered the car and waited and then  oh my oh my WOW The engine is so smooth The leather seats are divine The iDrive system is easy to use so I dont know why Ive read so many complaints Step on the gas and it goes as fast as you want and faster than you realize The sound system is much nicer than in my previous car After 20 years I gave up driving a manual transmission and I am thrilled I bought the car just about fully loaded and I dont have any regrets This car is a great combination of style luxury and power My husband tried the backseat during our test drive and said its roomy Hes not a small guy either Wed do it all again
1,Traded a 05 Ext cab Z71 Bad move Have driven 1000 miles and it sounds like the front end of this Z71 may fall out before I can get it back into the dealer Gas mileage is 145 05 averaged 179 22 on highway Has a serious lag when taking off from stop and when trying to pass Is going into shop tomorrow
0,Researched for 6 months and waited for 35 months for the delivery Nothing compares to this car for the money Great combination of power and design I traded in a G35 sedan and I could die in this car BMW thought of everythingYou will feel like a child at Christmas when you grab the wheel I now have a dreams of dry pavement winding country roads and the sun shinning Police officers beware
1,I love the new look of this vehicle but bad mileage has turned me very sour The interior is charcoal and is a lint magnet Every week I try in vain to clean it and in one use it becomes totally covered in lint I think the 48 liter motor is too small for this truck
0,I live in a small town in Texas and I was unsure which model to purchase at 48 years old I settled on the 328xi coupe with 6 speed manual My dilemmas 1 Does the 328xi have enough power Yes and with the extra safety of the xi it came in handy during last weeks downpour 2 Will the Sport package with 18s and run flats be rough Smooth even on my bumpy road 3 Will the 6 speed manual be fun or in the way A blast to drive and the Bluetooth works great for hands free phone 4 Will the coupe be large enough I have a 10 year old I take to school and Im in sales and I have to travel with a few extra bags I believe that this is the best car for the money with a good size trunk
1,Not sure why people have a problem with brakes and tires Ive got 55000 miles yea 55 thousand and brakes dont squeak Also got 43000 out of the tires you have to actually rotate themHave pulled a horse trailer is great forgot it was back there Didnt get Bose speaker system but regular system does good for what its for At 55K miles still got 8mm left on front brakes for unknowing people thats awesome Only one aggravation passenger seat squeaks Other than that I plan on adding another 55K miles to it pretty quick Oh yea 21 MPG on a trip from Orlando Im sure Ill get more when I go to Miami
0,I traded my Allroad for this sedan with some trepidation but the BMW has not disappointed With the 6speed manual transmission and sports package it is a true blast to drive Its been three months and so far the car has been flawless in all respects Theres plenty of room in the cabin and with the optional cold weather package the rear seats fold down nearly flat greatly expanding the trunk space
1,Ive had this truck for about two years now and have put 26k miles on it Hit a deer three days after I bought it talk about bad luck I got that fixed and really cant complain about this truck at all I did have to replace the cheap wiper blades last month and after reading some of the other reviews I have also heard the steering column make a little noise but nothing major For the price this truck was hard to beat
0,I did not like the style initially but got used to it and saw the advantages and improvements in design as I drove it Every day I fall in love with it
1,Chevy  Built like a rock by all means Original tires gone at 20000 Tranny shifts like a rock also with a kick in a butt from first to second gear and slowly leaks Good low end torque at first gear but when passing on a vehicle in moderate traffic at second or third gear pressing past halfway causes it to downshifts and produces potentially dangerous force Had me sliding sideways in rain often Not that I cant handle it but hey there are civilians around Loaded it with 22 5 Gallon jugs 35 lb each Rides like a caddy without shocks Added leaf spring helpersnow rides like a true rock and nose dives like a fish Nothing personal lucky its leased
0,This is my first and the last BMW I had Mercedes cars before used and couple new ones and I thought that BMW has a better quality but this is not the case Ive got my 335i miracle on September 5 2006 as 2007 model In two weeks fuel pump went down on a highway road It took one week to repair In January 2007 Ive got an engine malfunction on the car dashboard The car dealer reset the light and BMW HQ said too much alcohol in the US gas In the same day Ive got the light again Now the car is on my dealer repair shop a second week already and BMW HQ still cant fix it One time more of the same light and the car can be classified as lemon
1,I bought my 07 to replace a 97 GMC 1500 Z71 and have not questioned my decision one bit This truck is nicer than any vehicle I have ever owned I have added 9000 miles to odometer since my purchase and have only one minor complaintthe noisy brakes However I took the truck to a local Chevy dealer and the problem went away under warranty Great truck
0,I love this car It handles well rides smooth and it certainly looks like a million  dollar dollar on the inside and outside I am extremely happy with the decision to buy this car
1,I bought this Silverado classic ext cab 2wd in oct 06 for 25k Trade value now is 6500 Two reasons the first is the 43 vortec v6 It is way underpowered The transmission grinds and tries to shift too much between 35 40 mph I had the transmission replaced at 30 K unacceptable I wanted to give GM another shot after driving Fords for so long I will not do it again Vehicle rides good and I get about 175 mpg around town
0,I traded in my 2006 Lexus IS 250 AWD for the 2007 BMW 328i coupe The driving dynamics between these two vehicles is incomparable The BMW truly provides a sense of being connected to the road endless tourqe curve and responsive power and stabilty The hum of the inline 6 on the BMW is music to any enthusiasts ears as soon as heshe pushes the ignition button It begs the question Why pay more considering the sophistication level of the cars overall design standard equipment level driving dynamics and quality of materials
1,When I bought this truck it was my first major purchase on a vehicle Im now 23 years old I drive at least 60 miles a day back and forth to work Gas mileage is what youd expect from a truck good for this size truck but gas prices stink now so Unlike everyone else my brakes dont and never have made noise The seats creak a little and the fuel pump is a little loud Its probably going to die soon oh well It does drive extremely well for a truck The truck is everything I expected from Chevrolet All Ive pretty much done is service it no major issues People crying about the hood design and rock chips get a bug deflector it works imagine that Am still on original tires brakes
0,Just got my first BMW  07 335i sedan with autopremsportcoldpaddlessat What an exhilarating driving experience Very responsive excellent acceleration awesome exhaust sound and great handling Must drive in sport mode Great curbside appeal Once you test drive it youll want one Nothing close in its class Man  what a car
1,We bought this to replace a wornout 2001 GMC Sierra It is everything we wanted Great comfort great room nicely appointed Pulls all four of our boats like a breeze Our 17 yr old daughter has no comfort complaints when riding in the rear seat This purchase was done online as a dealership trade at a distance of some three hundred miles from my dealer to the one with the truck Got  dollar7000 off from Chevrolet and  dollar3500 off from GM card How could we not afford this truck We also like this better than a 2005 Tahoe we had for about a year
0,I have wanted a BMW my entire adult life and Im thrilled to finally be an owner Great performance and awesome styling
1,Bought brand new with 100k warranty auto air tint cloth 6040 seats work truck Gets 500 miles to the tank on the highway in Utah About 21 22 19 all around No problems so far hauls boat ok Paid 15k with two ski season passes plus 10 additional Now have close to thirty and tires are starting to show wear
0,My wife needed a 4 seater to commute in and in a pinch toss the 2 kids in the back The ride is breath taking Atheletic powerful fun Back seat is tight even for a 5 yr old What made me buy this instead of Lexus IS 350 or 250 was the ride and its EPA rating of 30 on the hwy I was hoping for at least 25  No Way This thing swills the fuel like one of my golf buddies pounding brews at the 19th hole But did I mention how much fun it is to drive
1,I guess I expect more for my money but this was a total rip off A lifelong Chevy owner   and family we purchased it in January 07 Since then constant brake squeaking steering column moaning and now the overhead compartment broke loose After reading all these other problems people have had I would not recommend this truck  with the price you pay Chevy needs to learn to make a truck that doesnt fall apart Seriously disappointed The dealer has done all work on it and even they tell me Chevy knows that brakes are their 1 problem Save your money  buy something else thats not in the shop every month With domestic junk like this no wonder GM is having a hard time
0,This is the best midlife crisis sport sedan I have ever owned and driven Got the 335i with SportPremiumCold Weather package after being blown away by media praise of its awesome 060 stats and overall performance Every review about it is true It handles like a gokart and when the speedo approaches 80 the cars stability makes it feel like its only going 40 with more power to spare even at 1400 rpm when Im lugging it in low gear While the cupholders seem a bit oddly placed I love the four doors heated seats sound system manual tranny and interior roominess If I take out my driver I can fit my golf bag in the trunk without dropping the split seats Cant wait to drive it
1,My Silverado 1500 Classic has already had to have the rotors and drums turned What has happened to Chevys quality It took the dealership2 tries to even figure out what was going on In town driving onlyit has the tow pkgwhich I dont use The mpg is horrible Have been a Chevy family for a long time but no more
0,I have had this car for about a month and put 1000 miles on it By far the best car I have owned Outruns my 04 545 easily I used to want a 911 but this thing would easily keep up with the standard 911 Got the red interior and it looks really good with the black wood trim Fuel economy has been around 2021 Great sound system Havent fully explored the handling yet as I have been breaking it in A great car
1,This vehicle cost 36000 With 11250 miles and 10 months old the best trade offer I could get was 17900 It has been in the shop several times for a total of 22 days Worse yet it is a replacement because the 2006 model I had was taken back in under the Lemon Law This one barely missed falling under the same law Buying a Chevy truck is the absolute worst vehicle purchasing mistake I have ever made  I will NEVER buy another Chevy
0,This is the third BMW 3 series that I have owned The new turbo engine has more power than any other car that I have driven More than the 2006 M3
1,I like the truck Ive had the steering column replaced 3 times Ive had all 4 door speakers replaced It has a rattle in the dash area that is hard to find I would purchase another Chevrolet but will go with the 2008 body style My family has 3 other Chevy trucks with similiar problems
0,Highlights Liquid smooth power deliverydrive train Handling is not too bone breaking but sporty excellence Comfort is in spades and its roomier than all of the competition Style is beyond compare I like looking at it more and more every day
1,Drove Fords for the last 40 Years converted this year dont know why I didnt see the differance before this Completely satisifed
0,I have had this car for about 3 weeks I recently turned in an 03 Benz E500 after a 4 year relationship Shopping for a new Benz I decided to finally drive the other German sedans Well I have to say the fun factor pins this car off the scale After 5 minutes I was sold No contest in driveability and ride dynamics The small BMW gives up a modest amount of power and torque to the Benz but more than makes up for that in driveability I find myself looking for an excuse to drive Never felt that way in the Benz I could have gone for the 335 but the 328 was plenty for me in addition to getting a bit more mileage and probably saving me some tickets
1,Nice truck for the money I was looking at Tundras but couldnt beat the price with the Silverado Not a bad truck but it does have some annoying issues Fit and finish is poor in my opinion I am very picky about my vehicles and do not like dash rattles and seat squeaks I have already had the wheel flares replaced due to defective paint the rear window has been replaced due to the defrost lines not working It has the typical dash seat and door rattles and squeaks This is annoying on a brand new truck with only 10k miles on it I wouldnt discourage anyone from buying one but just beware that no vehicle is perfect and this one has its fair share of problems
0,First time BMW owner and I think I am spoiled already Ive had this car now for 3 days and just looking at it make me excited Everything from how the car handles to the style is amazing
1,Just so you know I would have preferred a Tundra But the new Silverado was thousands cheaper than a used Toyota plus it had the 100K mile warranty Not a bad deal at all Plus it was supposed to get better mileage than the Tundra Anyway its a good truck for the money
0,This is the first time I have purchased or driven a BMW I have to say that this vehicle is by far the best thing I have had in a long time It handles like nothing I have ever driven I wanted a car that would excite me from the second I got into it till the time I got out of it Well when I drove this that was it I have to check everything out so I went to drive the jaguar the mercedes the cadillac cts the mitsubishi spyder convertible which by the way was the vehicle i really wanted till I sat in the bmw I couldnt get the feel the way it handled the tightness of the car the smoothness of the ride etc out of my mind I love it
1,The 07 Silverado is a great truck Very solid rides great handles great not squeaks or rattles Sits low in the front for a 4x4 but only requires slight adjustment of torsion bars to get 2 more lift in the front I get over 20 mpg on the highway with the 53 liter It has great power and acceleration I drove the Dodge and Ford equivalent and Chevy has them beat hands down Dodges are less money but dont have the power Ford F150 cost more and ride like crap and dont have the same space as the Chevy extended cab You cant go wrong with this truck
0,First impressions awesome brakes really quiet inside at hwy speed torqueHP If you want a car with power handing and comfort this car is it Well worth the money I went up a mountain with easy I got over 29 mpg on a 180 mile round trip including some stop and go traffic I did keep it around 70 mph I get stares from everyone on the road but the people staring the most are other BMW drivers I have used the iDrive before and it does take some getting use too but you will pick it up I drive a lot at night so self dimming side mirrors was a must The 18 inch wheels make it look sweeter so I recommend the sport pkg I recommend the Comfort Access I regret not doing so
1,I purchased this vehicle to tow a travel trailer which it did very well in the beginning I dont have a lot of room so Im going to list the parts that have been replaced on my truck at 50000 milesFront Locking HubsPressure Relief valveRear endComplete Engine with turboTurboFront axle I paid  dollar38000 for this truck and am now over  dollar13000 deep in repairs the warranty would not cover the engine they said I drove through to deep of water and it sucked it into the intake from the bottombad investment on my part I guess these 4x4s arent supposed to leave the pavement
0,I took delivery at the Spartanburg plant where BMW puts you up for the night feeds you a great dinner breakfast and then two hours on their track using their cars two hours of touring the plant and museum lunch then 2 hours of the delivery program The whole program was so cool I highly recommend it It was the greatest experience Ive ever had buying a new car You guys already know how great the car is take advantage of the delivery programIts free Ive had a 911 Volvo 850 turbo Suburban and my last car was a 328i convertible which I kept for the last 9 years This 335i coupe is the finest vehicle Ive driven and my wife drives a e350 and Ill take the BMW
1,Bought new to tow 5th wheel 60 liter gas engineauto trannycloth interior Getting 14mpg around town speeds range from 60mph to 30 mph stop and go Have not had an unladen trip on the highway yet so I dont know the mileage there but will by the end of July  Im hoping for 18mpg Paint is thin and scratches very easily  a big disappointment for me Interior is dated exterior is boxy reliability has been good but I only have 6k on the the beast Build quality is average Ride is stiff even at 50psi in the tires It does have power Lookout boys its gonna unwind
0,Just over 1000 miles so far This car wants to go without hesitation Solid connected to the road A joy to drive Almost as much fun to drive as my S2000
1,I have now had my 07 duramax 2500HD for two years see review under by name Over 30000 miles later I am even more impressed with this truck I have had exactly no major issues None This is not what I had expected since it was an American made truck This is our car of choice for long tripsit is so comfortable Gas mileage seems to be getting a little better with diesel engine around 19 to 21 on long trips 16 to 18 in town I would buy this truck all over again
0,This car outperforms 95 percent of the vehicles sold today The car has beautiful styling and the interior fit and finish is superb No need to spend thousands more on a 5 or 7 series BMW because this car has the perfect blend of luxury and performance
1,Great performance have to check the mirrors to see if the car hauler is still behind me when Im towing Interior seems smaller than my 04 but still comfortable A little too much bling with the chrome bumpers and the bulges in an attempt to make it look bigger than it really is Had the front bumper painted black to match the body color Looks a lot cleaner
0,At the first time I test drove a 335i sedan car at a dealer it really blew me away in ways I couldnt describe Since then I knew I had to have one for myself so I ended up ordering one w premium pkgsport pkgsplit rear seatauto with paddles Being a very careful consumer before the order I test drove similar cars from its competitorsbut none really got me excited as much as this while some of them had looked really good on paper You should give it a try to know what Im talking about
1,I get poor gas MPG with the 6L VORTEC V8 which should be bore tech because between the crappy shifting in the 6 spd trans always shifting drives me nuts and the 95 Miles per Gallon with only a work box on it Plus the suspension in can not hole the work box Max payload is 3800 lbs and the box alone weights that Bad choice by me and listening to the salesperson get rid of an old truck and not paying a little extra for what I really need Bad part is I would loose over  dollar8000 dollars to sell it Plus what it would cost to get a new one Upgraded suspension cost installed  dollar3875
0,We took Europan delivery on our 328i in November and had great weather so we really had a chance to drive And drive we did a fantastic car in the mountains on the highway in the city and on rural winding roads The car is intuitive The car turns heads even among the Porsches Benzes and Ferraris There is just nothing to improve Even fuel economy was better than expected and at 100 mph I had to roust my wife from her tour book Hey look what I am doing Do yourself a favor and go drive one today
1,After having two Z71 Suburbans I gave in and purchased a truck that could pull my 30ft RV and still be driver in the city This is a great truck quality is tops I have almost 4000 miles and have not had any problems I have also noticed that once the truck warms up the mileage is not bad for a big gasoline engine I have averaged 16 on the road and around 13 in town Considering the size power etc this is not bad The six speed transmission is great for pulling My RV weighs in at about 7500lbs and you cant even tell its there I have driven in North Carolina pulling the trailer in the mountains with no issues I havent missed my Suburban
0,I went in to get my oil changed on my 06 330i and ended up driving away in a 335 what a difference a year makes This is our 4th BMW in 2 years and we keep on trading them just because I used to drive an 87 911 930 and remembered that kick at around 40 mph  well this is nothing like it Smooth powerful absolutely beautiful I would highly recommend this car to anyone
1,After much discussion between gas and diesel we went with the Duramax Just awesome is all I can say We just pulled a 4 horse trailer cross country 9 days and 6500 miles later my back was not even sore from the ride Engine never slowed across any of the mountains Plenty of room to lay out in the back and sleep while trading off driving I revamped some built in headrest dvd players from an H3 and they look great Should be an option
0,The rave reviews from the auto magazines did not overstate their experience with this car It is simply one of the best in the world The car is blindingly fast but also very comfortable as an everyday driver The broad torque band is amazing could make you lazy about downshifting The ride is moderately firm without being harsh and it is much quieter than the 2005 model that I had Handling is excellent characteristic of all BMWs Without being ostentatious the styling is aggressive yet refined a headturner wherever I go Best car Ive ever owned
1,Great truck The ride is better than either Dodge or Ford across my dirt roads On the highway it does not ride as well as my wifes Suburban but still much better than the other trucks I have Handles well better than most trucks that are not sporterized I test drove all three domestic truck lines and this was head and shoulders above the competition Fuel mileage is low but this is probably due to the engine break in period
0,I waited 3 months to get this car but it was the best decision that I ever made This car is the best The power it has shocks you The luxury is amazing the look of the exterior is stunning just an amaazin car Only one con the price is a little too high for a 3 series but I love it and its worth every cent
1,Transmission is junk 4000 miles after warranty expired the transmission failed Searches on the internet produced many hits with the same issue It seems Chevy knows this is an issue and has failed to do anything about it Sad that a vehicle that costs over  dollar50k can fail after only 40k miles This is my second Suburban to have the same problem Definitely buying an import next time Americans cannot build cars
0,An awesome car Very fast and fun to drive I traded my Volvo S60R AWD for this it makes the Volvo seem like a bus
1,I cant remember if its LT or LS Its in the shop right now for the ac heat issues Ive had with it since I bought it used a year ago I have 3 kids and 2Lg dogs it was excellent for driving from Alaska to La last summer besides the heat going out while we were in the mts and ac not working once we got in the southern states Ar dealership changed a part  dollar250 Mechanic here changed parts twice  dollar800 Dealership here is trying to charge me  dollar2000 to replace half the ac  The shocks make it ride like a Cadillac Flex fuel doesnt seem to make that big a difference It does guzzle oil The captains chairs in the center would be ideal in all of these large SUVs and make my job easier
0,2007 335i is a great car Twin turbos supply plenty of horses yet good fuel economy Typical great BMW handling and braking Interior is well laid out and more room in the back than previous 3 series Have really enjoyed the car
1,Wife traded in her 2005 Tahoe for this truck it has been great A couple of minor problems  knob on rear control fell off and piece of plastic in storage area broke but besides that no problems Have seen the dreaded low oil light once brought it in It is currently burning 1 pint of oil every 3K miles so I hope it does not get worse  dealer said this was common
0,I have had this car for two weeks now and absolutely love it This car is solid smooth fast and of extremely high build quality Handling is so stable and accurate I have had two previous 3 series and this one blows them away Its not a slow car but its not a racer either Put it in drive sport mode and it feels as fast as my G35 coupe I traded it in for I do think it could use about 15 to 20 more ftlbs of torque though My past experience with BMWs is that they get much faster as they break in The 2007 model has 15 more HP and ftlbs torque than the 2006 model
1,This is a nice SUV when we purchased it it was much more expensive than they are today The truck is used for both work and play The truck has served us well but it has had many service issues from the trans going out to the DVD CD player that stopped working at 38K Please keep in mind it had maybe played 20CDs and 10 movies in its life GM has been poor when it comes to standing behind this SUV After over 30 GM cars in my life this for me is the last one my wife will only drive GM so I will have one in my garage In the end this is a very expensive car to maintain out of warranty
0,This is my 3rd BMW and it is my favorite The new 230 HP 30L has plenty of power I thought I wanted the 335i for the added power but once I drove the new 6cyl I was sold This was plenty of power for me and most others Im sure My other BMWs were both coupes so I am quite used to the styling the back seat is a bit harder to get in and out of compared to my other cars but not a deal breaker I do agree the hokey seat belt stick will be a problem long term
1,This is such a nice truck Its a shame that the value of the vehicle drops like a lead balloon My MSRP was  dollar56000 Its now worth 27K on trade Less than half in a year and half Should have bought a Lexus With what Ive lost on this one I could buy the Lexus Why is it American cars lose their value so fast compared to the imports The leather feels like pleather not a soft type material How sad that the Big 3 need a bailout Maybe we should stop building these vehicles and leave it up to the foreign car market How sad If you are thinking of these be ready to take the big hit on resale value
0,I thought I would buy the new G35 sedan but after test driving the 335i there was no doubt that this was the car for me Great power Great design Many cool bells and whistles Amazing leather Though the car is an amazing performer it needs some refinement with its adaptive transmission I like to drive aggressively but when the wife and kid are in the car I try to take it easy The transmission causes the car to lurch off the line when I try to take it easy
1,Got rid of 05 Freestar  excellent mini van  because of whoops baby Plane Jane 53L 3 cloth bench seats rear air after marked twin DVD system sindle CD15K miles down and not one problem I can get 18 to 20mpg  and not a pinch more  by driving with my big toe Wife gets 16 to 18mpg wher 80lb foot Not so good mpg on E85 as advertised but performance does not suffer Has been through four seasons and the 07 winter in WI was rough and did everything I asked of it Rides great stops great doesnt sway in corners too much cmon its a biggie Fit  finish is great Easy to work on for the doityourselfer oil changer but would change location angle of drain plug
0,This is a very awesome car since I purchased this vehicle I definitely get a lot of looks from people who havent recognized the new body style of the coupe and from a lot of car enthusiasts Previously I drove a 4 cylinder which had plenty of get up but the increase in horsepower from the inline six as well as the excellent handling gives me more than enough to enjoy my drive
1,Nice looking truck but way too many serious issues in two years SW issue that causes battery to drain when the battery drains with this particular issue then call a flatbed Front right axle seal leak cant be truly fixed as this is a design issuejust keep replacing the same gasket every time it starts leaking 4wheel driver failure Front transfer case bearing failurespecial order for parts required Rear plastic bumper loses shape on the bottom within one yearlooks very cheap Very frustrating
0,This is my second BMW and remains the ultimate driving machine The vehicle is response tight fun to drive
1,I bought this truck over a year ago i could not resist I had a an Avalanche before which I used for both construction and leisure made over 70000 miles and let me tell you I new I could depend on Chevy After having a baby and with the anticipation for the new Chevy model I purchased Suburban and I would not change for anything else The possibilities with this truck are endless Its a safe smooth ride love the space
0,This 335i is my third BMW and includes two prior X3s Because its a BMW I didnt test drive the 335i before it arrived  just ordered it  got in and drove home BUT WOW  will this car accelerate handle and cause stares wherever I go Its Sparkling Graphite Metallic with a Cream Beige Dakota Leather interior with Light Poplar Natural Wood interior trim I added the Premium Pkg Active Steering teriffic addition Metallic Paint Steptronic Auto Transmission a really great six speed thats smooth very quick and efficient and finally the Sport Pkg Between the Premium Pkg and the Sport Pkg BMW adds a lot of extras in them so there wasnt any others I wanted
1,This is our first Chevy SUV Weve had the Ford Expedition and an Acura MDX Interior design looks cheap Weve had numerous issues and recalls to contend with Key fobs not working replaced latch on 3rd row seat there is not enough horsepower with the 1500 and in Houston traffic merging onto the freeway is dangerous The Nav system is designed poorly and ineffective And now latch on other seat is broken Weve not even had this car for a year yet  and it has been in the dealership for repairs 56 times in the first few months If I wouldnt lose so much Id trade this car in today for the Expedition EL Do not buy this car  go for the Expedition EL
0,Just picked up my new BMW coupe last week and I love it The six speed is fun handling is fabulous and the interior is stunning I am inventing errands just to go driving It has exceeded my expectations My husband loves it too and he is not a car person One thing I am surprised by is that it is more refined feeling than my old BMW I like the new cupholders I wish dealers were not trying to make these into lame cars for incapable people by stocking them with navigation and automatic transmissions I had to special order my car 2 months ago to get a manual coupe sport pkg in alpine white Those options IN A BMW call for a special order This is ridiculous America
1,If you dont want the price of leather skip the 07 Suburban We traded in a 02 Suburban that we loved and got a lemon The fabric seats attract lint and hold it even through a vaccuuming with a  dollar600 vaccuum We have to vaccuum and then use a lint roller to even get close to getting the seats clean We purchased fabric because we were so satisfied with the Chevy fabric in our 02 Suburban and 05 Chevy pickup The 07 is a step in the wrong direction At 64 I also have a problem with the location of the 4wheel drive knob I knock it and turn it on everytime I get in without realizing it Our 3rd row passenger seat has also had the knob for flipping it forward broken twice
0,Besides being one of the more comfortable cars with 300 hp the 335 coupe is more fun than any car i have owned yet This car will sell itself if you can get to the dealership and test drive one This is my 3rd style BMW and by far this is the biggest jump in style and performance from its previous generation The only thing I didnt like is you dont have the option to buy the car with normal tires The only option  run flats and you can never repair them Everytime you have even a slow leak with a runflat you have to buy a new one and if you decide to put normal tires on theres no room for a spare
1,I have had the 07 Burb for 7 months now It is my 3rd Suburban If you need to tow forget the 2500 The hitch height is 23 vs the previous 15 and is a pain to set up It is clear that the new Burb was designed for the ladies and the 2500 should have been dropped The factory NAV system is so limited that I use my Garmin portable and shut it off GM was obsessed with form and style rather than function on the 07 2500 The 60 engine is whimpy for a serious tow vehicle Id sell today if I wouldnt lose my behind on the deal I only have 6K on the odometer rather than the 12K to 14K I put on my previous Burbs in the same time
0,Speed and suspension are excellent Handles like a champ on turns Not many people know about it right now so its a sleeper
1,The truck is real nice but it is a Chevy and everything you have read about Chevy turning its products around is wrong Now it is better than the 06 model but still does not come close to the Japenese I have the sunroof and it rattles like crazy I took it back to the dealership and was told nothing wrong and I would have to deal with it So I have  dollar45k rattle trap The interior is very nice plenty of room I guess its about preference I looked at the Toyota Sequoia and the Chevy does have a better interior and more room But the quality is still not there like Toyota Its all about what you want but dont be fooled its still a Chevy
0,This car is completely addictive from the noise it makes through the shoveinthe back acceleration to the informative feel of the controls I did not know that driving could become so entertaining again and that after a day in the office I would look forward to the process of commuting home It looks gorgeous too and is full of smart features some rather overthought but many more useful than one would expect
1,I just bought a 2007 2500 60 Suburban to replace my previous 81 The 60 is way underpowered and gets about 15 mpg less than the 81 during normal driving and 5 to 10 less when towing The worst part is the wind noise when towing I had it fixed with a new engineering upgrade to the weatherstipping and flip gate glass and it still is really bad The GM engineers said that this is a good as it gets and that since the noise is only during towing thats the current fix Good answer for a  dollar50K vehicle If you tow bewareThis truck is severely underpowered and the wind noise will drive you crazy
0,Im a 3series nut I previously owned a 2001 330ci then a 2002 M3 Convertible The 330ci was a bit too slow The M3 was fast but too harsh to be comfortable The new 335i coupe is a perfect combination it is as fast as dare I say FASTER than the M3 but far more comfortable It looks and feels incredibly classy handles extremely well is the perfect size is fairly economical Im averaging 19 mpg in combined driving and really isnt all that expensive considering minivans now cost nearly  dollar40k The 335i is by FAR the best combination of sport comfort and beauty I am shocked at how much I love my new 335i I also suspect that these cars will hold their values very well
1,I purchased this truck as a secondary SUV to my wifes LX470 Although not quite as refined as my wifes Lexus the Suburban is not that far behind It drives great has tons of room way more than the Lexus looks great I love the 07 redesign and gets far better gas mileage than the Lexus while providing more power Also when comparing to the DenaliESV I found the Suburban to be a far better value with very comparable features  the horsepower difference does not seem that noticeable in everyday driving and the low gear is important to me as I will be driving at times in deep snow in VT I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a fullsize SUV
0,Just purchased 2007 335 Sedan w SptPrmSatAuto Incredible car Keep in mind that the sedan is the same body style as 2006 only visual difference is the badge and dual exhaust tips It will absolutely rocket Have owned an M3 Benz 230K and BMW 328 This car is equal to a current M3 in my opinion as far as acceleration and handling There is no other car in this class that can compare with this degree of power handling interior and exterior style Bluetooth is awesome feature Stereo fabulous Have kids so must have the sedan Actually I like the rearend on the sedan better than the coupe Incredible car
1,I would have given the Suburban good marks for some of the design features but I wanted to get everyones attention Donot buy this vehicle if you drive in snow We hit a minor snow drift and are now out over  dollar900 for front bumper repairs After extensive time on the phone with GM they were unwilling to stand behind the vehicle They said it was caused by environmental issues The environment they are talking about is the reason we have a 4x4 Now when it snows we cant leave the house until the road is plowed I dont have any idea what were going to do when it snows while were away Based on GMs unwillingness to stand behind the design this is the last GM vehicle Ill ever buy
0,What a car I have owned a 325iC X5 X3 328i but I have to say this is the best BMW that I have ever owned It is just so much fun to drive Great acceleration handling around the bends If you are going to buy the 3 series coupe you have to get the stick just adds another level of fun to the overall experience I have been told by my passengers that it is fun even in the passenger seat The blue tooth works great and sounds great I love the automatic seat belts Interior design is just awesome I have two kids 14 and 11 and they love the back seat very comfortable Havent had a chance to drive the car in the snow but I am looking forward to that opportunity Great car
1,Trunk well put together Tight and quiet Fuel mileage is as expected for mountainous region168mpg Radio volume is a bit weak when trying to crack up to a good XM radio song Overall very content with this vehicle BTW I moved from an Diesel Excursion to this Burban
0,First time owner of a BMW This car is just amazing The 328xi drives like butter I picked it up about 5days ago and I have already put almost 600 miles on it I just cant stop driving it My car is fully loaded The only option I did not order was the window shades All I do is drive The other nittygritty details like wipers coming on when they have to slowing down when approaching a slow moving car opening doors without keys getting directions are all taking care of by the cars huge brain I cant wait to drive it in the snow
1,I am a longtime Suburban fan and agree with all the good stuff said in other reviews However my Suburbans have always been business multi use Suburban cargo handling has always been great until now With the 3rd row removed and the 2nd row upright there are almost no flat surfaces just bumps and dips Floor distance only 7ft 6in Door will not close on occassional plywood runs Also not happy that I had to special order 2wd No 2wd delivered north of Kentucky Go to any lot in MI All 4wd with sunroofs Adds  dollar3000 Ordered Suburban Sept 28 Built in Mexicoargh Nov 15 Delivered Dec 12 Thats 75 days Thats ridiculous
0,This is by far the most amazing machine I have ever driven I came from a 325i which I thought was fun I did not realize the difference there would be This is a gentlemans sports car Cant imagine a 100K car being any more fun that this one
1,I absolutely love my new Suburban I cant believe I waited so long to buy it It handles towing the boat with no problem I cant wait to take it to Mammoth for a little fun in the snow
0,Having driven 2 new M5s in the last 6 years and a 645i it is difficult to find the words to describe how powerful and thrilling it is to drive the new 335i Sedan The engine is a masterpiece running sub5 060 and getting nearly 30 mpg on the freeway Steering is precise braking exceptional and suspension tight with a great exhaust note In addition the interior is comfortable seats the best in any 3 series ever and the fit and finish are excellent Exterior styling could be further distinguished the only obvious difference bet the 335 and other models are the dual exhausts The coolest feature may be the real time traffic right on the nav screen either on the map route or in text form
1,Ride is great but if you demand a smooth ride dont go over 70mph Steering feels like you need a good tire balance They put new tires on after 500 miles and had to force balance just to get it within specs I feel like I got a lemon I hate sitting at long red lights It feels like at idle that its missing a plug wire Junk
0,I thought I wanted the 2006 330i sedan and began the process of selection a year and a half ago After awaiting the 2006 new model I decided that I would wait awhile longer for the coupe to appear Am I glad I did Wow it has proven to be worth the wait I am thrilled with the style comfort and performance of my Montego Blue Metallic 2007 335ci My concern was always comfort with the 3series which is why I didnt accept in in the early 2000 models but this car is so roomy I am 6 feet tall and 215 pounds Everything about it is first class The interior devices are all within reach the moving parts work well and the comfort is without flaw What a great product from BMW
1,I have the LTZ model The build quality of this SUV is amazing dead quite inside no rattles or squeaks Interior materials are outstanding too Steering is precise and direct and the brakes bite The overall driving experience is that of an expensive German sedan The engine sounds great when you floor the pedal and power is impressive at higher RPMs Lower in the power band though torque is not overwhelming A six speed transmission apparently in the works will certainly help I dont know where they get those fantasy fuel economy numbers from So far suburban driving has yielded 11 and a trip to Maine with a loaded car 175 milesgallon Overall not bad for such a big SUV though
0,Traded in my 02 530i for this car and have no regrets It is an absolute blast to drive it looks fabulous and it is really comfortable Recommend the sport package
1,We really like our 07 Suburban We had a 2004 but decided to purchase the 07 for two reasons As the mother I wanted to get it because of the side curtain airbags and the backing up sensors and camera My husband wanted to buy it because it is sweet We havent had it long but did lots of research and dont think we will regret it We have black exterior black leather so Im not sure if we have any mismatched colors like the other reviews I really wish GM would put moms on their beta team for future models
0,Great car A MUST test drive 95 percent of the performance of the 2006 BMW M3 at 75 percent of the price BMW hit a home run here
1,Very few 2500 4WD 34 ton on west coast Vehicle drives extremely well on wet pavement Comfort is excellent plenty of room in the back for food kids etc Compared with Tahoe for the same price but with 3 extra feet of cargo space XM satellite radio does not work on major roads where I live in Washington Wish it came without wood grain finish but only in LS models Center console is a little confusing
0,I currently drive a 2003 Audi A4 30 quattro Today I testdrove the 335i coupe with premium and sport pkgs manual transmission and this is going to be my next car The power was incredible and reminded me of the 97 M3 I used to drive The brakes were also M3like However the ride was not  it was beautiful smooth quiet firm but not punishing It was my opinion of perfect balance between performance and comfort This car is FUN I no longer dream of purchasing an S4 or M3
1,Lots of little cabin noises You feel every little bump in the road like a sports car Front passengers sit like a compact thanks to the ever trendy monster center console while the rear is like a school bus 2nd bench seat is in an unconfortableuprightfixed position wont recline 3rd seat is very difficult to acess Every time you adjust the AC or turn the car off and on the AC reycycle turns off My 06 Silverado does the same thing We live in Atlanta and use recycle because it cools much better and wont pull in cigarette and exhaust smoke in stop and go traffic
0,Having owned an M3 and a 330 coupe I can say that this car is as close to the perfect combination of both as you can get A comfy every day driver like the 330 with an engine that rivals the outgoing M3
1,I have had a 2000 2003 and now 2007 Suburban Its like a Harley and motorcycles everything else is not a Suburban Regarding mileage in Houston we have Ethenol for 12 the year which kills mileage to 12 or so When I can get nonethenol gas it goes up to almost 19 highway
0,I just got my car last week and only put 200 miles on it Its a joy to ride and the driving experience is so intense you can feel your heart beat faster than usual I compared it to the Lexus IS 350 which i think is the closest rival Lexus has a better interior for my taste and both appeal to me exteriorly but the difference is the handling BMW really hugs the road and you can feel like you really are a part of the car BMW made me agree that it is the ultimate driving machine I am a first time BMW owner i hope the reliability is not that bad
1,I must accept that at the beginning I was a little concern about the reliability of this truck due his history but I have to say after almost 3 years to own it that this is the best truck Ive ever hadNo complaints at all Just visits to dealership for regular maintenance and for a 58 V8 engine 17 milesgal is not bad 
0,This car is simply unreal The performance handling and styling of this car are second to none The power is always there with the driving dynamics to match BMW has done it again
1,The first 36000 miles of my first big american suv ownership were great Now that Im out of the warranty period I can understand why people who havent been down this path before get easily burned by some american auto products However Ive now had the rotors turned at 38000 miles and the other day I had to replace the entire power steering assembly  dollar900 I tried reasoning with the service manager that this was way too early to do for such a new car I cant blame him for the problem he didnt tell me to buy the car hes just telling me how to fix it Very frustrating
0,Just bought launch car last week Love everything about the car Simply amazing combination of ride handling power racy looks Always wanted 3 series but never enough room I am 6 6 and the new larger 335i interior fits me perfectly Lots more performance than Z4 much better ride than M3 Makes my old 540i feel like a Buick 
1,I like the size of the interior but ergonomically this vehicle is challenged Keep hitting the 4 wheel drive knob with my knee getting out No creature comforts such as change holder sunglass storage etc It holds everything I can pack into it Had the dead battery issue Had battery changed at my expense because the dealer said it was good No more battery issue I have 70000 miles and get 17 MPG The way to do it is coast on every downhill stretch of road even the short ones Coast to every red light Need tires now Had uneven tire wear but got 70000 via frequent rotation So far no mechanical problems The seals are poor and the ride is loud as everyone else has said
0,Drives very nice quick and smooth power A little quiet Beautiful interior My first small BMW but it feels larger than it is
1,The factory running boards are dangerous I have had two people fall while getting out of my vehicle They seem to become slippery and dont have a good amount of traction to them This should be reported to GM and corrected I also dont like the exterior door handles My driver door handle seems to stick in the out position when closing or opening I am a tall guy and when I get in I often hit my knee on the dial that controls the lights on the left side below the steering wheel This should be better placed
0,Im fortunate to be one of the first in the DC Metro area to buy the new 328i Though I have not yet had a chance to take it out and really enjoy it initial reaction to everything including performance design and comfort is positive Nothing drives like a BMW And in this case nothing looks like the 328i The headturning quotient is off the charts
1,From the day I got my Tahoe the 1st month it had been in the shop 3 times for the dashboard popping up The little things such as sometimes the window wont go down doors wont unlock when I want them to other things like when airconditoning is on it makes a high pitched squeal but yet it only does it once in a while and the wont fix it because its not happening at the time I bring it in But the part that really stunk 6 months after buying it it got stuck in FWD and I put it neutral to get it out but that wasnt working so I got stuck on the side of the road for over an hour till the dealership picked me up When you buy a new car it should be reliable
0,Was looking to trade in my 2003 BMW 525i Looked at and test drove the BMW M3 745i 550i Acura RL Infiniti M3545 Lexus GS450 and Audi S4 I saw the 2007 335i on the lot test drove it and fell in love Ended up purchasing a 6 speed manual metallic space gray with CoralBlack leather interior
1,I bought this vehicle new from the lot The window moldings kept popping off a defect which was confirmed by the dealer The front seat is too small for me I am 510 It is made for soccer moms The pedals are too close to the seat and the steering wheel is not telescopic Adjustable pedals wont push them back The plastic on the sideview mirrors was separating and the battery died twice I did not leave any lights on
0,Very nice car turns heads everywhere sleek design the sport mode is incredible Very pleasurable experience much smoother and much more comfortable than the current 4dr 330 FAST
1,My 2007 Tahoe was one of the 1st to be released and I have had multiple problems with DVD rear view mirror door molding power locks and folding seats But main issue is with the poor reception of the FM   and XM radio I have had the Tahoe serviced 3 times for the radio and they cannot fix the problem it may be the poor placement and engineering of the FM   and XM antenna in the rear back glass Radio fades in and out when passing by power lines trees building drivethru windows Very irritating especially when I paid more for the premium Bose system
0,This car is like all BMWs hugs the road and plenty of power the only downfall is the design of the seat belt function which ours needed to be fixed the day after we bought the car I like the location of the windows in our old 2003 325i better BMW sold us the car on the wonderful exterior design that makes this car stand out
1,Great handling quiet interior Navigation is a plus The third row seat is pointless since it gives you almost zero storage behind them Fuel economy is fair at 16mpg avg after 10000 miles Drives great on a long trip and feels just as at home on the beach LTZ pkg is the way to go Just do some homework before you buy You can search local GM dealers inventory online and then request a price via internet Right off the bat youll save 10 percent off MSRPThis car is not your old Suburban Its been completely redone
0,Interior is much better then the previouse BMW designs very solid when driving good HP and handling its something I recommend every family to put their kids in safe from inside
1,I love this car You can hardly tell you hit a bump and the gas mileage has been great I drive 100 miles or more a day and it has not been as bad as I thought it would be Everything is designed with my family in mind Well designed
0,I havent really had a lot of time to drive this vehicle but it is incredible After test driving this and several competitors this was the one that stood on top It just handled like you wanted a car to but felt you were riding in a more expensive vehicle I highly recommend this car to anyone who loves to drive and wants to enjoy the ride and relax at the same time
1,After 32 years of driving this is the first new vehicle my wife or I have purchased Our previous 1985 Chevy Suburban 74L with over 316000 miles is getting tired but still going However the opportunity fell in out lap for a great deal on an 07 Tahoe and one test drive is all it took to make our first ever new purchase Although my strong ties to the Chevy brand which I have been driving since 16 OK 15 but dont tell anyone I think finding a better value is not possible Comparing to other SUVs in its class there is no competition Sure one could pay a zillion dollars for a Mercedes SUV but for the average Joe or even the upper crust the new 07 is hard to beat
0,Bought my 335i after begging my wife to drive her 535i for 6 months I chose the sedan over the coupe because I do have people in the backseat frequently The car drives like a rocket on wheels Fast but also very smooth and refined in most driving situations It is the only car I have owned in 45 years of driving that excites me every time I start it even after a years ownership An unexpected plus has been the gas mileage It has consistently delivered 22MPG city and 30 on highway cruises It has been extraordinarily reliable with only routine dealer visits all covered under warranty
1,I love my Tahoe especially now that we have added 22 rims and Billet GrilleBowtie We tinted the front windows and customized our plates and its wicked The only thing I regret is not getting leather We live in the Valley in CA and black leather would be too hot but the new fabric interior is awful Everything sticks to it We have tried fabric softener sheets and sprays We constantly get it cleaned and are still using a lint roller to clean the fuzz that sticks to it Only complaint
0,Thankfully BMW has a 50000 mile all included warranty with their cars The performance is great I love the car but there are definitely material issues 1 Steering wheel peels 2 Turbos rattle and wastegates need to be replaced 3 Door locks fail and have to be replaced 4 Plastic and rubber pieces scratch easily
1,Mileage rating and drop back to 4 cylinder performance is a joke My own SUV which is the LTZ and is fully loaded had a faulty climate control system and one speaker which didnt work from the start The windshield has a scratch in the middle of it The rear hatch had continuous squeaks in it which the dealer corrected The dash still has a constant squeak in it which I dont know whether or not will ever be found The polished aluminum wheels and their quality are a joke for the price that GM charges considering a set of four high end chrome American Racing Rims would cost much less The spare tire is a different brand than the four driving tires which is another waste of money
0,Purchased as CPO was a dealer loaner Drive is generally good and it looks and feels like a BMW Performance off the line in regular automatic is poor but sport or manual mode makes it feel much better Brakes and cornering are very good but the trade off is a bit of a rough ride especially over long distances Fuel economy is about 23 mpg combined cityhighway Interior features are good and feels spacious except that radio stack cannot be seen with sunglasses on We also had a random failure of one of the side mirror covers on the highway when the plastic part just fell off and was replaced under warranty If you can get a good deal its a good solid car
1,This is one of several Tahoes I have owned I have vibration in steering wheel and bumpy ride came with Bridgestone tires the dealer has replaced the tires and seems to have solved the problem I like everything about the 2007 Tahoe except I think better tires should come on the Tahoe
0,This vehicle work great for me because I used to have a Volvo S40 and a S10 chevy truck and got rid of both for my touring and so far its being good for my purpose Good to travel
1,This is the first vehicle both my wife and I have purchased in 10 years First mistake was purchasing this Chevy We had leased 7 new vehicles prior to this purchase This way if we had a problem or just didnt like the vehicle we could turn it in a few years later I have recently made my second payment on this vehicle and the car is dead No one at Chevy knows why and no one can give us an answer They have had this vehicle for 10 days now The vehicle still will not start All they can tell us is the engine has no power when turning the key This is my wifes new vehicle and we have 3 small children We depend on this vehicle which had left us stranded an hour and a half from home
0,The car looks great top up or down Its quiet You can have a normal conversation even with the top down It has a comfortable cockpit feel and is fun to drive My biggest complaint is the Run Flat Tires My car has the sport package with different size tires on the back Picking up a small nail at 800 miles I learned that BMW and Firestone would not repair it a new tire cost  dollar350 plus and neither had it in stock The car does not come with a spare or a jack If you get a flat pray that youre close to home because you can only drive 50 miles and then you are stuck probably for days I bought a spare wheel and tire With a second flat at 4000 miles I put regular tires on
1,The last 6 vehicles we have purchased has been new and almost all of them have had close to acurate gas mileage claims when purchased however the 2007 Tahoe that we have is no where close With an advertised 21mpg we are experiencing 135mpg highway after 4000 miles Our dealer is side steping every question we have and trying to stall us telling us we will not see the 20mpg range until the vehicle has 15000 miles on it We purchased the Tahoe because we were only getting 125mpg in our Hummer H2 and wanted a better gas mileage vehicle We feel that we have been mislead
0,This is our fourth new BMW in the last three years There have been several things that have made us glad that our time with this car is coming to an end It is a stunningly beautiful car but that hasnt overcome the transmission that doesnt shift properly or the run flat tires that have to be replaced every 12000 to 15000 miles due to excessive noise or the unexplained occasional electronic gremlins that show up and cant be diagnosed
1,I traded in a Trailblazer for the new Tahoe The truck drives better than the Expedition Armada and Sequioa that I drove The interior is just as comfortable as every other Chevrolet but it looks much better On the highway the ride is quiet and comfortable Off road performance is great with the locking back end and autotrac but be sure to remove the front airdam before going on extreme outings If you have a boat then the G80 differential option is a must I got  dollar2500 off the sticker price I am getting 19mpg mixed with the 53L not bad considering the size and towing capacity Gas mileage is better than most midsized SUVs and all full sizers
0,Very smooth and powerful engine Passing on 2 lane roads acceleration 50 to 90mph is quick Engine torque allows 6th gear acceleraton at highway speeds wo downshift Amazing torque for 3Ltr engine Much better than wifes Acura TL At high altitude in Colorado I was amazed at ability to use cruise control on I70 over loveland pass at 11000ft elevation 6spd auto trans ensures engine always in correct torque band Brakes easily modulated and strong Handling outstanding Car goes where you point it In corners sets up quickly and tracks easily Able to corner at higher speeds with confidence During 4000 mi trip in sept 08 averaged 302 mpg During trip from AR to SD UT CO back to Ark
1,I owned a 1999 Tahoe and traded it in for the 2007 Although the new Tahoe is lightyears ahead of the 99 there are a few things that I would say are not quite as nice The first thing are the engine gauges In the 2007 they are alot smaller and harder to see The gear shifter is very close to the stering wheel and I hit the wheel when I shift it They radio will not play cassette tapes However the air conditioner in the 07 works alot better and you can aim the air where you want it The Bose sound system sounds very good but doesnt seem to be as loud as the old radio My truck came with Brigstone tires I love the DIC Sounds great when you get on it I dont mind about the 3rd row seat
0,Extremely slow steering for a bmw It takes so much cranking of the wheel just to make a simple turn and on top of that the effort is really heavy And they dont offer active steering in xi models The bridgestone runflats are joke A fairly quick stop will make them slide Starting from a stop is jarring Press the gas in automatic mode and it will first pause for a while and then buck and jerk while it decides if it should continue in second gear or downshift to first It goes through coolant and oil pretty quickly Much faster than scheduled maintenance happens Oh and forget about spirited driving without sports packagethere is NO seat bolstering whatsoever
1,Man all Ive got to say about this truck is that its the best bang for your buck I gave up a tricked out 03 BMW 330 to hop in this big body truck The things you can do to it are endless There is so much room inside Theres room for all the screens you want to put in it and if you build a custom box for your subs and still keep the 3rd row Plenty of ride height 22s 24s 26s whatever you want I would never go back to small cars again If anything Ill upgrade in 2 years and knock off the new Escalade cause its just sick If youre thinking about getting the new 07 Tahoe all Ive got to say is go for it
0,I love the styling and the car proved to be a joy to drive until I got my software updated Instead of boost coming on before 2k RPM as advertised there is now a significant amount of turbo lag BMW has altered the performance of my car without my permission possibly to minimize wear and warranty issues with the turbos Until this problem is resolved I would NOT recommend a 335
1,At first I thought that America could not build a quality not notch vehicle Until I walked into a Chevy dealership with my friend For years the magazines and newspapers rave about Toyota Honda Nissian and I fell for it I admit it now that I let others influence my choice of cars for the last 15 years I opened my eyes and found that GM is by far making the best cars and trucks out on the market today I went back to Toyota and Nissan to compare there fullsize trucks to the Chevy Back and forth for weeks It was clear that I made the best decision I let my friends borrow my truck for a couple of days and there was nothing negitive that they had to say
0,My son and I traveled to Europe to get this car via BMWs European delivery program Fantastic Driving this car on the autobahns and alpine switchbacks was the experience of a lifetime The twinturbo engine is unbelievable  Incredible power 30 mpg on the highway Superb handling Two years and 22k miles later I am still in love with this car The 2009 models have most of the improvements that I would want except still no Msport option I would also be tempted by the super efficient 50 mpg diesels that are best sellers in Europe
1,The 2007 Tahoe LTZ is a surprise to just about everyone on the planet GMC actually got a redesign right I have yet to find a problem or a reason to complain about anything From experts the only downside they mention are in reference to the third row seats Some actually say they are heavy or difficult or cumbersome to remove for added cargo space This is far from correct You place your hand on the handle and they roll Yes roll right out The rear view camera also must be mentioned Its perfect I my self cant believe it but this vehicle IS a 10
0,We purchased this beauty and love the car The only problem we have is that the convertible top is not working like it suppose to It has been in the shop 4 times since we purchased the vehicle The first time it was a computer chip where they literally had to take out the back seat Then it was another computer glitch and now the top when it is closed makes noises The runflats I am not impressed the ride is rough when you hit a bump and then the tire light comes on Other then that we love the car
1,We recently traded in our Ford Expedition for our new Tahoe with the LTZ package and never looked back This truck is miles ahead of the large SUV competition The ride performance and interior design is unbelievable We made 163 miles a gallon on our last tank of gas Not bad for a 5500 lb truck You owe it too yourself to take a look at the new Tahoe it may change your perception of the American auto
0,I leased my 328xi coupe about 20 months ago I have not had a single regret Awesome driving comfort power styling and not too bad fuel economy for the rewarding performance I calculated my fuel consumption and it was 22 mpg combined my commute includes highway and inner city driving and I like to use the SD and M modes a lot too The more power of the 335 would probably be even more fun but for a first time BMW owner I am more than happy But what I was truly impressed by is the 4wheel drive on the snow I live in Ohio and my 328 had no trouble cruising on snow when other larger 4X4s were slipping and skidding beside me Note get the 4season tires not the Performance tires
1,This is a great suv  I did not know about 2007 models until I went to the showroom and saw one I got all the stuff except the DVD player The ride is great the front suspension change makes this feel like a sedan My wife know has taken control and I no longer can use this car GM did a great job  we traded in our great 2004 Tahoe  what a diffrence The only con is the navradiorearviewcontrol system is a major distraction  its hard to drive without looking at it and therefore taking my eyes off the road
0,Bought the car used with a whopping 600 miles on it Have had it for 3 months and added 7000 incredibly fun miles I have owned 2 jeeps both soft top 2 Volvos 1 Lexus 1 Benz 1 Ford and 1 BMW years ago  this is by far the most fun to drive and the only one other than my first Jeep that has garnered great comments from other drivers Took it in for regular maintenance service early at 7600 miles as I dont want to wait til recommended 15000 miles I expected to pay for this one myself but dealer took care of it anyway Great car
1,Took a trip to Nashville the week after we got our LTZ and enjoyed every minute of it The ride comfort and performance was superior Weather conditions turned bad unexpectedly with a snow and ice storm we just slowed down and reached our destination safely and without a lot of stress Boy did we get a lot of attention at Operyland the Tahoe that is
0,The look of this vehicle is one of the best Definitely a head turner I had a problem with the top minor issue I also got a flat tire on those less than par runflat tires Luckily I had purchased the warranty so I was reimbursed for the high price tag Not sure impractical in AZ All in all great car
1,The 07 Tahoe LTZ has the added feature of riding better than the Escalade of old and as good as the current modelThere are 2 drawbacks  one is that nav pkg wMP3 player  cd  amfm radio does not have allow for multiple cd cartridge Not a big deal but curious for such a great vehicle We got ours on 3106 and it is a gemThe second is that they did nothing to improve the gas mileagestill lots of good stuff
0,Bought my CPO 328i in April 2008 and the first problem was to already be fixed Hey it was small no big deal From there the electrical problems never stopped After its fifth time in the shop went to close the door and the whole panel popped off The problems never stopped until I traded it in for an Audi A4 two months later which made me much happier The dealer nor BMW corporate would stand behind their product 2005 was the last of the good years now they drive like an economy car They are completely living off their reputation and building lesser quality cars After four BMWs I am done
1,Like the look of the new Tahoe inside   and out better than my 02 but I am not without issues New vehicle has displacement on demandbut seems like it should have been geared to allow a 60 mph cruise in the 4 cyl mode So far fuel economy on new vehicle is worse than my 02 Will have to see how it does when taken on a trip Rear visibility is not good headrests on rear seats dont help
0,My husband wanted a BMW for a long time I wasnt as convinced what all the fuss was about but now he cant get behind the wheel I love my Monaco Blue Coupe When I put it in sport drive I just feel exhilaration Looks very sporty and edgy Just love it
1,Im sorry I listened to my wife and bought this over the Sequoia what I wanted Driving on highway after 38 miles and car died suddenly and for no reason Towed in and replaced a wiring harness which was improperly installed Now at 155 miles the gas gauge starts wildly going back and forth Took it back in Does look decent on inside Ill give them that and is stylish outside But two trips to the shop in first 155 miles is indicative of faulty build quality I will not own this vehicle any longer than I have to and will think long and hard before buying another GM product If I had to spend the money over again Id get a Sequoia
0,I love this car I wanted a wagon for the extra room but I wasnt going to compromise handling or fuel economy getting a crossover SUV I like to test drive cars and have test driven a lot I was ready to buy another Passat wagon I loved every 100000 miles I put on my original but then I test drove a 3 series  it was all over There was no comparison with any other car that I have driven Somehow they have combined the handling and comfortable ride like nothing Ive ever driven Good MPG I took a 600 mile trip through mountains Driving in the 80 range no cruise got 26 Before the mountains rolling hills some towns cruise set mostly around 65 I got 30 everyday combination 24
1,Just bought an 07 LT3 put LTZ 20s with new shoes on and this thing rocks Needed a bigger truck for work fits the bill perfectly and more Dont ever buy one of these new and refresh every few years There are plenty out there with low miles and if you can afford to pay the gas and maintain not one tire at a time you will not go wrong
0,Ive had my car 8 months and done a few 12 hours road trips Great car to drive smooth economical for the performance fast and responsive Generally a quiet and comfortable car though the cabin noise above 100 mph is a bit high  not sure if thats the tires or that its just our highways in the midwest really arent built to be driven at that speed Steptronic is nice but occasional problem jerking when accelerating from a dead stop Also tested an auto Infiniti G35x but no comparison 2627 mpg on highway average about 19mpg but I drive a lot of startstop in Chicago and its hard not to gun the engine
1,Other than my disgust with GMs fabricated guesstimate of gas mileage  says the Tahoe should get 21 mpgwhat a joke I like the ride and the look of this truckcar My 04 Tahoe got much better mileage but upgraded to an LT and like the interiordashleather seats 3rd row seats are useless Probably wont go with GM again  too bad for the blue collars
0,All around this has been a great car for the past year It has averaged 21 MPG with a 65 percent city 35 percent freeway driving mix and that is with some spirited driving on many occassions On a recent road trip 400 miles I averaged nearly 30 MPG So to get that kind of MPG from a car that has 300 HP 300 lbfeet of torque and can 060 in 55 seconds is amazing One complaint has been the runflat tires Bridgestone Potenzas They tramline ride harsh and dont have the best traction If I MUST have runflats the Michelin Pilot Sport ZP would be a better choice Overall the car has been nearly flawless and completely reliable My mirrors have a memory setting problem
1,This was my fourth Tahoe Purchased the Z71 and liked the body style but wish I would have kept my 2002 Cheap interior finishes lots of road noise due to cheaper door seals Just run it thru a car wash and open the rear hatch to see how well the seals work Also have replaced the shocks on the rear hatch and it still doesnt open all the way Gas mileage isnt what GM cracked it up to be Terrible resale value Are you kidding me it isnt worth 12 of purchase price after less than two years GM could have done much better with design and quality on this one Im afraid this may be my last domestic vehicle
0,I ordered the car 18 months ago with Automatic Premium Package Cold Weather Package Navigation and Parking Assist Its worth every dime It looks great handles like a dream and has top notch buildquality very German Though it is not anywhere near the top in term of horsepower count power delivery is excellent making highway passing and merging very easy Fuel economy is surprisingly good for a car that offers such performance Unlike many other V6s real life MPG is pretty close to what is shown on the sticker The free maintenance program is another nice touch
1,I purchased this vehicle because of the room offered Gas mileage is a big disappointment 134 avg even driving normally I had the battery drain issue when I first purchased but this was fixed immediately with a software upgrade Dash area looks a little cheap with the plastic overdose Great on an 1800 mile trip Tire rotation is cost prohibitive at the dealer Cheaper to buy new tires as needed Agree with the need for fold flat 3rd row seats These are bulky to remove Resale price nowadays is a nightmare Would recommend
0,I purchased the wagon to accommodate my granddaughters weekend stuff for getting to my house Anyway thats my excuse for buying the 328i wagon It has been a great road car It turns corners just a good as the sedan Looks great and the sunroof is wonderful in place of my droptop I traded The wagon is a better deal than an SUV for gas mileage and getting around town More headroom than the sedan in the rear Great car for older folks vs the minivan look Provides extra space in the rear with the split seats for getting back and forth from shopping
1,Electrical headache Been towed to dealership 4 times since purchase Told all 4 times it was a bad battery Now for the 5th time its dead in driveway 30min after I turned it off guess itll be battery again Driver mirror doesnt work lumbar in seat doesnt move and seat somehow starts to heat up even though the button is off Also contrary to what the dealership tells me the dash lights will randomly go off at night and start to flicker Apparently none of this can be duplicated so GM says it isnt happeningghosts I guess
0,Fell in love with German engineering with my first VW Golf then a GTI then went Japanese with the Acura TSX which was beautiful but didnt have the chutzpah But none of them compare to my 2007 328xi Have it in dark green with brown interior and light wood Have it for 7 mos now Beautiful Always wanted a BMW since I was a teen with dreams The power and the way it handles are like no other Ive driven Drive it into a turn  it reacts with ease You feel the road but very comfortable Dont mind the run flats Im thinking next to get the 300 hp but there really is a lot of power in the 328 Radios weird so are cup holders Big fan but new A4 coming soon hmm
1,Purchased my LTZ and have had nothing but problems with brakes and engine lights Even the rear tail lights fell out the day I bought it Have dealt with Chevy and dealer for Lemon Law supportof course got nothing but arguments Lots of repairs going on not much fixed after trips I stopped counting after I couldnt count the trips to service shop on my two hands What actually happened with brakes ended up finding out squeak pad was installed on the wrong side of brake pad Oops Engine light that was coming on constantly intake manifold was not bolted on correctlyafter 8 trips to the dealer they made this amazing find My truck must have been built on a Friday at 4
0,I always wanted a BMW and finally made the purchase I have the sports package and get about 24 mpg doing a combination of city and highway driving Probably the biggest treat is being able to quickly merge into commuter traffic Coming from a Jeep Wrangler merging into commuter traffic was painful My BMW is a ton of fun to drive and I am so happy with my purchase
1,3rd row seats are useless unless you are a midget or child Room is really compromised since they only fold up and although removal is easy putting them back in is a chore They are quite heavy and is you are not careful you can scratch the plastic items in the back
0,Wanted a BMW my entire adult life Purchased a new 2007 328i 4dr and am really enjoying it I have never considered myself a car guy but the power and ride that this vehicle provides is exceptional While my overall expectations were met and sometimes exceeded there are still some opportunities that I believe BMW should address such as the poorly crafted leatherette seats and the illplaced cup holders
1,We purchased our 07 Tahoe in 06 It has been a joy to drive I dont hurt when I get out of it  Handles wonderfully in bad weather and pulls a load like no full sized truck weve had before  We have had a few glitches tho we had a problem with the battery going bad after a few months Bought a new one problem solved Power lift gate off track still not fixed The real problem is the transmission went out at 105000 All our miles are highway miles This should not have happened it just went out  We called OnStar for a diagnositics couldnt find a problem We knew there was one tho So any way we got online and there are pages and pages of transmission problems So check it out before you buy
0,I am a performance driven customer and its the best performing vehicle Ive ever driven Which is not saying much for a former Integra and Civic Si owner but I enjoy every minute of every drive especially spirited driving I have had the car for a little over a year 9K and have had an oil sensor glitch and a rear lamp failure which was covered by the warranty BMW touts free 4year maintenance which says an oil change every 15K that seems crazy to me so I recommend servicing the car at least once between the free ones The AWD felt very stable in the typically mild north VA snowstorms
1,At 45K miles the vehicle is in the shop for its second transmission rebuild first occurred at 29K Dealer initially told me that a loaner would not be available but after a call to the service manager they provided me with a Cobalt The vehicle does not make good use of its interior space 3rd row seats offer no room for passengers or storage behind Overall I couldnt be more dissatisfied with this purchase
0,This is our second BMW the first is a 750I My wife wanted something sporty and the 328i Coupe fits the bill The design is a work of art add in the performance and this car is a masterpiece It feels looks and drives great
1,I love my Tahoe  it rides very smoothly I have not taken a road trip as of yet but I can hardly wait The only downside is the gas mileage and gas being so expensive My experience thus far has been great
0,Fell in love with this car from the first online announcement designed to suit with every available option and upgrade waited 4 months for delivery Worth the wait handles marvelously turns on a dime corners on wet pavement effortlessly incredible front passenger sporty comfort spunky acceleration but I do feel some turbo lag
1,Wish I had never purchased the 2007 Tahoe The battery continually dies and the source has yet to be found It has been to the dealership 5 times with no resolution While many of the features are great they are over shadowed by the frustration of finding that the car wont start and having to charge the battery at least twice a week The nicest thing I can say about the Tahoe is that it looks pretty sitting in the driveway Very expensive yard art This will be my last GM purchase
0,I have owned this car for 1year and 2 months All I can say is wow My 060 times are 48 seconds The car handles like no other 4 door Car handles great in snow and ice The DTC is out of this world and doesnt let you spin out the car in the snow
1,The brand new Tahoe is not what I expected I took my first trip in my Tahoe to Reno where I experienced the throttle sticking whenever I would press all the way down on the gas I actually had to use my foot to push the pedal back up Thats not safe at all The interior cloth seats collects so much Lent Now Im looking into replacing with leather which is costly Another complaint is the plastic lighter covers are so cheap that two of mine have already fell off I think for how much the Tahoe costs they have should of been built better The older tahoes look a lot better than the 20072008 I take the blame I should of did my homework before getting locked into a car that Im not happy with
0,Ive had this car for about a year and Ive had little to complain about The car is very fun to drive and very comfortable However the run flat tires are AWFUL and need to be replaced with regular tires They make every bump a jarring experience and make hitting minor potholes feel like you just got hit with a sledgehammer They also seem to have some deleterious effect on highspeed cornering maneuvers
1,This is my 2nd Tahoe my first being an 01 After 2000 miles had to have the tires replaced and since then have had it to the dealership for wheels suspension or something along those lines 4 times and still cant find what is causing the problem I am very disappointed with this vehicle My other Tahoe was 6 years old when we sold it and the biggest problem with it was a washer fluid motor This Tahoe seems to be a cheaper build with the window seals interior etc Bring back the old craftmanship with the new concepts
0,I have about 5000 miles on this car It is a dream to drive and the ideal practical yet fun to drive sedan I previously owned a 98 328i and this car is leaps and bounds better in every category I was a little nervous about opting for automatic transmission this time but I neednt have worried With manual sport and D modes to choose from and quick shifting it is exceptionally competent and fun It doesnt hurt that the massive torque is available at almost any RPM so acceleration is strong in any gear The run flat tires are a mixed bagI like the safety feature but dont care for the harsher ride and potential expense to replace
1,I like the way it looks but would much prefer my 02 Tahoe My Z71 has been factory modified to allow the gas cap to open fully The door and window seals are way cheaper lots of windroad noise compared to older models This is my fourth Tahoe and not as fun to drive Give me a break on the third row seats that dont fold flat The rear hatch openers wont fully open even after being replaced Another design flaw is the hatch will easily get caught on any ice build up on the bumper I hear everyone compliment the interior build quality but I dont see any improvement in fact I feel it is cheaper Im concerned that my new Tahoe wont stand the test of time
0,One word wow This is my first Bimmer Ive owned American muscle cars and turbocharged imports but nothing combines drive and performance like this 335i It has the raw power of my old V8 camero and sticks to the road like my 300Z  the best of both worlds Almost all the cars on the lots were auto and all had the premium package We ordered ours from the factory in Germany in order to get a 6 speed manual gearbox with all the sport options and very little of the premium options no idrive thank goodness It arrive in 5 weeks It feels like we got a production M3 right of the box We have had it for almost 7 months now and its still a thrill
1,This is my 4th Tahoe   and I loved all of them until this one I liked the look of the car 2nd row captains chairs the DVD player Then after I started driving it I noticed a loud noise from the drivers window sounds like the window is open What kind of carpet did they use where you can hardly vacuum dog hair off of it Last winter my rear hatch would not open automatically in cold temps Found my battery dead twice took the car into the dealer was told there is computer problem with this car Hopefully that is fixed My coolant level is always low but dealer says there is no problem Had door molding fixed but it keeps separating Now my wipers dont properly work My last Tahoe
0,I have owned seven BMWs over the last 30 years beginning with a 1974 2002 This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned It performs just as advertized The engine is incredible Very smooth powerful and fast And the car actually gets 21 mpg around town and 29 on the highway automatic tranny The front seats are comfortable but the back is a little cramped although not bad for a convertible What is really amazing is how quiet the car is when the roof is up Solid as a hard top This is truly one of BMWs best creations and I recommend it to anyone who wants a great convertible
1,I had a review posted on 61507 I had the truck for 2 weeks or so at that point with no issues Ive been to the dealer twice since then to have them tighten up stupid and random squeaks rattles and other noises I understand that a vehicle will eventually loosen up but Ive had this car for less than 9000 miles and its been doing this since about 2000 Im very disappointed in the build quality and Ive received several comments from friends to notice the weird noises It does not speak well for Chevy Other than that the vehicle has been very versatile My wife and I have taken it on several trips and the mileage has been better than expected 21 on the road 16 in town
0,Traded in our beloved 2004 325i wagon the wife actually cried when we gave it to the dealer for the 2007 328i which we knew couldnt be as good as our 2004 model WE WERE WRONG The 07 is more refined better handling faster and smoother than our old wagon Only area of concern to me is run flat tires I much prefer a spare but have had no issues at all
1,When I purchased my Tahoe on year ago I didnt really expect to encounter the problems that I have run into I have had my tahoe in the shop severaltimes in the past year for things that should have not failed First the main module in my computer system failed while I was driving tires went bald at 14000 miles The dealership then had my car for almost two weeks trying to repair I have had severaly issues with the computer system since that first time and it is actually in the shop as I speak for problems with the transmission computer failure lockunlock buttons not working back door pad not working and Rear seat dvd system not functioning properly Will be the last Tahoe for me
0,You buy you pay and you pay some more But you have a blast while your doing it Also make the right choice and get the manual
1,The ride is good but I cant get used to the new seats I keep sliding out and have to brace myself to keep from being propelled forward when stopping I find it especially bad in the front passenger seat The seats are shorter from hip to knee than my 01 Tahoe I keep adjusting the seat and cant get it to be comfortable Im 56 I feel somewhat like Im too high up esp in the 2nd row and might wobble off the seat Needs more storage cubbies I really have to bend my foot back from accelerator to brake and I have the adjustable pedals
0,This is my second BMW The 335 is Very FAST smooth and fun drive Best veh I have ever owned Extremely comfortable from the heated seats to the heated cup holder I love this car and would not buying anything else My only regret I should have waited for the M3
1,This is my 3rd Tahoe Each one gets better than the last I kinda miss the old body style though They all have a great ride cant beat GM suspension
0,Its like a Pontiac Grand AmPrix from the front a Hyundai from the side and a Honda from the rear In one word its ugly However it blows away the last iteration of the xi from every aspect other than appearance BMW finally returned to the performance and drivability of the E36 chassis The engine is worth the price the appearance is a sincere let down Thats why they are releasing the 1 series It looks just like the E46 chassis models attractive but without a rear Come on guys make them sexy again
1,I liked the vehicle when I purchased it in May of 2006 The truck is a 2007 I have had some major problems with it like the main electrical switch for the door and window operations has been intermittent for some time My air conditioner blew hot and cold simutaneously The transmission has some major missed in it going forward and backward Everyone can hear it they just dont know what to do with it and how to fix it It is at the dealer now they thought it was finished but when we went to pick ip up it is making the same noises in the shifting gears and they are quite loud What does it take to get your truck fixed We buy fleet sales for construction crews so please fix it
0,You will really love this car if youre interested in a car that you want to enjoy driving I like to drive even if its just to the local grocery store or just to work during the week I have the 335 with the manual transmission and I just love every minute of it Any 3 series will give you all the driving enjoyment youll need or at least an understanding of why BMW is so special The twin turbo 335 in addition to the manual transmission will just add to that experience The aftermarket is also full of many performance mods that can easily make this car have between 350 to 400 HP or more The 300 HP stock rating is definitely underrated to begin with so dont compare numbers
1,I really like this Tahoe I bought black on black Black leather interior with black on the outside It will be hard to keep clean but when it is its a very sexy ride With the 2nd row leather bucket seats its very roomy on the inside It looks and feels like a limo Fuel mileage is not bad but what do you expect from an SUV at this size All in all Im very happy
0,I traded in my 2004 Porsche 911 for this 335xi needed a car for all the weather as I live in the upper midwest This car is not a sports car like the porsche but it can hold its own on the road  I have not taken this car to the track yet I customed ordered this car with manual and navigation The overall build quality of this car is excellent I have driven the car for 6 months and 10000 miles no problems so far The acceleration is there when you need it can pass 95 percent care with ease on any road The four wheel drive is very competent in any weather Average duel mileage with 70 percent freeway is about 23 mpg The iDrive was easy to use and very intuitive I would highly recommend this car
1,Please dont take the MPG ratings on the window sticker as gospel I believe mine was rated at 1722 I was averaging 145 Never got above 18 MPG even during travel of all highway miles Other than gas mileage the truck was well built Theyve done a good job with the 07s This is coming from someone who swore they would never purchase an American car However gas was killing me Just traded for a BMW Just got 317 MPG last week on the highway
0,After coming from my previous E46 3series the current 3 feels like the best yet The 335 engine is worth the extra money handsdown The power is truly amazing Its slightly larger than previous 3s but I suppose BMW is making room in the lineup for the 1series Fit and finish are impressive as always The car is literally an extension of your body when driving  extremely intuitive and responsive Some downsides include reliability minor issues mainly run flat tires slow responsiveness of iDrive and Comfort Access at times poorly placed window controls too far away and quirky voice recognition
1,I have only had my truck a short time but is great I rate it high on fuel economy due to the drop from 8 to 4 cylinders when at cruising speed This helps on trips and when driving at low speeds The interior is oustanding I left an 06 EB Explorer to get this truck and am loving every moment From the design to the handling the Tahoe has it all
0,I had always wanted a true convertible and when I read about the new 335 hardtop conv and the tt engine I plunked down my money I took ED delivery in July and we had a once in a lifetime expereince driving through the Alps and Italy It is now home and over Thanksgiving it had its first long trip of 1200m RT Although it is technically a very sophisticated car with heaps of electronic gadgetry  I have iDrive  it all works as advertised I even lowered the top on I95 in stopped traffic Needless to say it is fast and performs very well And it is quiet cruising at 100 as if it were a coupe Gas mileage isnt bad either getting 23 mpg in a mix of suburban and high speed driving
1,I looked at everything out there from midsize to crossover to large and the Tahoe just cant be beat for the money I put 1000 miles on it the day after delivery and loved every inch of it Weve only had it a month now with no regrets and lots of smiles Ive owned GM vehicles most of my life and I always research the market before any new purchase GM came out a winner again Keep up the good work
0,I have stayed away from BMWs for the last 5 years due to dissatisfaction with local dealerships and overall BMW attitude to customers I was lured back by the 335s promise of M3 like performance with more pleasant manners as a daily driver for a lot less money I was initially a bit disappointed as the car is heavier and less responsive than my old E46 328 I have since replaced the stock suspension with PSS9 coilovers and ditched the RFTs and put wider tires on front Its a completely different car and handles like a BMW should Its hard to beat as an all round car with room for four Most drivers will be happy with the stock performance but it can be substantially improved
1,I really like the new Tahoe Unfortunately it does have some problems The doors all squeak a lot on anything but a really smooth road Driver window also squeaks when lowered Three trips to dealer have not fixed anything and driver window now hass alot of wind noise Gas mileage was initially very poor but got better after engine was broken in and I reprogrammed engine chip
0,A great looking car Its a blast to drive Unlimited acceleration Almost feels like a go cart Love the ability to unlock the car and start it wo taking keys out of my pocket Seats not great for the bigger body as they are heavily bolstered Dont buy this car if you drive almost exclusively in heavy traffic When you cant enjoy its potential its just another car
1,I have had my LTZ already for almost 6 months and it has been at the dealer 4 times Air bag lights 4 wheel drive sensors tire pressure sensors and the latest was the wipers for this week Truck runs great when it wants too Gas mileage is very poor Forget it on E85 Even worse I actually get better gas mileage on my full size Chevy van with a load on it then my Tahoe If you have children flip 4 the model with a bench seat on the 2nd row
0,I bought an early 2007 328xi I have about 17k miles on the car now and its been a great car Zero mechanical problems It has great acceleration for daytoday driving and sport mode when you need to merge Major downsides are 1 gas mileage 2022 in mixed driving no where near the EPA estimate 2 noise from the runflats the loaner I had for my 1 year service was quieter which leads me to believe that these tires get louder with age I also had some paint peeling from the interior drivers side door handle Apparently almost everyone experiences this BMW replaced it in an hour no questions asked
1,Bad interior design No internal storage no place for window scraper fist aide kit or emergency road kit HiLo beam actuation unsafe push turn signal away from you to actuate now out of reach from steering wheel Takes too long to heat up Gas fill is bad design back pressure shuts off pump Gas cap design bad could come off in accident Excessive road and wind noise Not enough driver space Seat belt difficult to buckleunbuckle Beverage holder in bottom of doorTransmission seems to slip Auto door lockunlock disable annoying Too many icons use english language 4 icons representing lighting could not find airconditiong confusing Radio controls too complicated
0,Bought the coupe in December and have had a blast This is my first BMW and it has been a great experience Careful not to hit anything with the run flats  it will set you back  dollar400
1,Im pleased with almost everything about the new Tahoe The only concerns or objections are the navigation system the gas mileage and the noise in the head liner The naviagation system is the worst Ive experienced It will often direct you to turn where there is no road to turn to Also the Nav will direct you and tell you that you have arrived at your destination when in fact you are about a quarter mile away It has even sent me in the wrong direction when I was close to my destination
0,I landed a new job I wanted something fun that could turn heads I chose the perfect car I got the 335i grey on red leather Fast agile sleek what is there not to love Because I traded in the 10 yearold Mercedes Benz diesel I would never look at anything else I get compliments almost every single day because of the lines this car has I now get parked in front of the restaurant by valet If you are looking at it buy it
1,I rented one with 40k miles and drove it 3 days before returning it to the rental store Highway driving is horrible the cabin is so loud that there is no chance of anyone in the second row of seats hearing the driver unless you are under 30mph or yelling At 60 mph even the passenger needs to speak very loudly so the driver can hear You can hear and feel every bump in the road its quite sad We had trouble with both sliding doors Eventually one of the sliding doors did not shut properly and when we reopened it it fell off the track The dealership seemed unsurprised and just asked us to return it for another Very cheaply made vehicle
0,Car is stunningly beautiful Power of the 30 liter rivals a V8 Fuel economy surprised me 25 in town and 32 on the highway No negatives after a year of driving It handles so great on the road No body sway at all on sharp turns Handling is a dream

0,Ive driven this car coast to coast on all kinds of roads in all kinds of terrain and all kinds of weather Ive been driving over 30 years and this car seems perfect in every way
1,From what I have read many people are having issues with their sliding doors and gas gauge I too thing the gas gauge is useless This morning as my wife put 1 of my 3 kids into the car and went to close the drivers side sliding door IT COMPLETELY FELL OFF AND HIT MY SON IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
0,I recently traded my Volvo S60 25T for the 328i and couldnt be more pleased This car has great power excellent handling and an understated luxury that I find very attractive Over the years Ive driven Mercedes Saab the Volvo and a couple of highend Japanese cars The BMW outperforms them all The Volvo may be famous for its passive safety features but the active safety of the BMW is a clear winner To quote the BMW manual Everything Under Control
1,Battery keeps going dead for no apparent reason dealership cant figure out the reason and I am stuck paying a note on something I cant drive Apparently its rocket science nobody can figure out what the problem is and they dont care
0,I have never owned a car that turns heads the way this one does Put the top up or down at a stop light and watch the looks I have even heard I gotta get me one of those This is still a new car and only has a few thousand miles on it so far To say that it is fun to drive is an understatement This was a gift for my wife and it was a home run We have the atlantic blue a new color with the cream interior stunning The only problems I have had so far were self induced but after reading the manual all were solved I must have a Wednesday car because the workmanship is outstanding Unbelieveably quiet with the hard top up Great car
1,HelpJust purchased a few months agothis car has been in the shop 6 times for the gas gaugeit floats never gives the exact amount of gas you have I called gm they said it is this cars issue not defect They dont know how to fix itI am just stuck with it like thatThe sliding doors close then pop back open
0,I waited a long time for just the right BMW AWD 6speed manual stylish coupe and couldnt be happier A perfect daily driver for my needs Always fun Superb on two long highway trips so far Great combination of exhilarating when pushed and serene when cruising Unbelievable cornering forces generated even with the lowly Conti allseason runflats Completely predictable handling always Firm ride is OK but big bumps cause a resounding whack when suspension bottoms  avoid potholes Upgrade sound system is worth it  best I have heard Bluetooth works great Very little wind noise or buffeting with sunroof and windows open Beautiful engine Notchy shifter improving a bit with breakin
1,I hate my vehicle I started out loving it until it was in the shop within a month My rear hatch continuously rattles in the cold and was told on the phone by GM head office that because they fixed 2 different items on it it may no longer be under warranty If they would have fixed it right the first time is my argument After 35000kms my rotors were shot They machined them and flipped them and now after 70000kms They need complete replacement GM said that if they can machine them they will but if they cant they will replace them Mine were machineable so I got fewer kilometres than if they were replaced Not to mention the oil leaks and the constant door adjustments Run
0,Cant be too harsh on critique with so much to praise on performance Low end torque is all I need With steering that turns like a sticky roller coaster a warp drive tranny alone in its own universe and all the speed you need This thing is really the best But sacrifice for the privilege True cost to own is double that of a Mini and you must be able to drop it off at the dealer regularly without a grimace I have been in for repair a few times and will go back again while trying to remain calm After owning for 6 months the inconvenience is now starting to outweigh the fading thrill
1,I fell in love with this van Then all of a sudden the doors will not shut all the time the back will pop open or the side doors will not shut at all even if you shut it off the it locks up I am a mom with 3 little kids and this van is not a safe vehicle for anybody even if you have kids I think they need to just recall all of these junk vans and give all of us new for all of our troubles that we have with them My van has been in the shop at least 10 times for the sliding doors I would not suggest any one in to buying this van I hate it wishing I could get a new car
0,Had problem from day 1 with vibration when releasing clutch in 5th Dealer replaced trannyclutchtransfer case problem still persits Car was at dealer 28 out of first 51 days Dealer was very supportive They paid my first months lease payment BMW and dealer came through today and are going to replace the car with a 2008 model Im going in to order it tomorrow Even swap and lease stays the same Verdict still out on run flat tires Happy with the fit and finish and performance
1,I have had nothing but problems with my van since purchasing It has had the steering shaft replaced and the redundant controls on the steering wheel replaced The power sliding doors are the biggest joke They have had the entire motor and clutch assemblies replaced 5 or 6 times and also had to be realigned 5 or 6 times This vehicle has been a real pile of junk Whats worse is that this is the 5th GM vehicle that I have owned I never had problems with any of the others and GM does not care that I am having problems now They are simply content to keep patching the mechanical door failure and not actually fix the problem Whatever it is I promise this the last GM vehicle for me
0,Wow  what fun to drive I wish I had the extra power of the 550 or the 535 but this car has it when you need it I like to drive it in Drive Sport as it really hugs the road and gives me the extra boost of speed
1,Out of 1 year I have owned vehicle it has been in the service shop 6 times because of passenger sliding door problems Its either the door gets stuck in fully opened position 2x pops back open after closing closes partially then stops Door has been out of alignment 4 times and the the front passenger door was out of alignment once Other consumers have reported door opened while car was in motion Chevy has been unable to fix and seems to be stymied
0,Bought my Certified PreOwned with 18K miles Mileage is only mentioned a few times in the reviews so I thought I would confirm the reports of excellent mileage  Im getting 245 to 255 around the Wash DC beltway about 7030 highwaystreets Im looking forward to a road trip to confirm the high highway reports The comfort of the seats is also amazing
1,Ever since buying this brand new vehicle we have had nothing but problems Two weeks after purchase it was misfiring on 1   and 4 sparkplugs Then the stability traction control comes on when you dont expect it Youll be driving on dry pavement and then all of a sudden the abs comes on Had the ebcm changed twice the yaw censor changed but the problem keeps happening Its really scary when your driving down the road at 70 kmh and the abs start applying for no reason At first the code c0196 came up and now nothing comes up it doesnt even store it in the computer The dealer doesnt know what to do and GM isnt too concerned I drive this with my 3 kids and Im scared to death Beware
0,Best car I have ever owned and truly a pleasure to drive I commute 100 round trip daily and I look forward to driving this car even after 3 years and 55k miles Corners like a dream gets up and goes fast enough but keeps you out of trouble I have every option available except the night vision and active cruise control You must have the sports package as the looks and performance cant be matched Bought this car new with only 3 miles on it
1,I bought a Braun Entervan a Chevy Uplander that has been converted by the Braun Corporation for wheelchairs 7 months ago and have had it in the shop 15 times The ramp was improperly installed the Smart box failed the Braun wiring harness was broken and the Braun applied weatherstripping fell off I had a GM dealer fix some of these problems Ive also had Onstar problems seatbelt and molding problems that are GM issues The initial quality was very low
0,This is really a great car It has so many features  even after having it for a couple of months Im still finding new features all the time I just found that there are 2 compartments in the armrest Ive been told the lower compartment is to keep drinks cool This car drives great is very comfortable and smooth and with all its function it looks great too Ive driven a 3 series before but with 2 kids and car seats the 5 series is definitely the right size
1,Good warranty but not up to Kia Its about time Asian companies started to force GM to back thier vehicles instead of thier pathetic 336 coverage Seats are not well designed with some seats missing armrests in some models Standard model lacks side air bags Engine is cramped for having a large front end Cheap to buy 1 year old due to fact they dont sell very well May be best kept secret
0,Just bought this car about two weeks ago and I love it Just a beautiful car Drove Hondas and Toyotas before and no comparison I can see why people stay with BMW The car just feels well put together It feels solid on the road I got the sport package and I like the wheels and seats that come with it Great handling and acceleration although there is a little lag when you punch it which probably wouldnt be an issue with the V8 Fuel economy however is very good for this type of car
1,Vehicle is underpowered has a hard time catching up with cruise control settings Often resulting in high engine revs and downshifting Even with no cargo load Removing seats for cargo space is cumbersome and could result in back injury They are extremly heavy release and locking mechanisims do not work well Center console not well designed or user friendly
0,I purchased this car last year so far it has only been back to the dealer for the free maintenance I live in snowy Canada so a car that handles well in snowy weather is important this car was absolutely exceptional last year Performance balance and handling are superb The xi add on is well worth it Last winter was a very heavy snowfall winter and I drove the car without snows it drove like it was on rails some of the roads were unplowed slippery and the car handled it without a problem it gives you a great feeling of safety and it has not let me down yet
1,We as a family really liked the Chevrolet Uplander It has a really good look outside and inside The van gave us no trouble except a power door that ran for a extra few seconds a minor thing The dealer could not fix we just put up with it  If youre looking for a stylish van with nice preformance get one And if you need extra room get the EXT it helps a lot But if youre looking for a van thats a little more useable look at the Honda It has the seats that fold in the floor The Uplander sort of has it but not as effective I worked with all 3 vans and my fav is still the Yplander I think next van from Chevrolet should be more thought out
0,Being military overseas in Germany I was able to purchase our New 5 series at well below what the US dealers ask My wife and I saved thousands and were able to get the 525xi with all the toys and luxury items we wanted and deserved This car is awesome The mileage this weekend touring Germany got us 309 MPG
1,Just purchased this vehicle Drove 2000 miles to FL and was overall very well satisfied Fuel econonomy 25 26 with full load of luggage and 4 adult pass Ride was very comfortable better than the Camry I prev owned Only complaints were needed longer armrest for passenger side up front Arm rest for drivers side OK Difficulty trying to get in 3rd row seating Liked the exterior design which was not the typical minivan look Dont know why this van hasnt been given a better review from the experts based on my experience so far
0,I have owned 5 other BMWs including a 7 series This is the best one I have had from an all around driving experience The 6 cylinder has outstanding acceleration not much different from the 550 I test drove Gas economy is amazing for this kind of car Handling is fantastic and overall ride is close to perfect I convinced my 82 year old dad to buy one and he now feels the same way
1,Having minivans for the last 8yrs this one is just another in a long line of vans So far though we like the ride with larger wheels it feels smoother and quieter With the dvd in the middle the driver no longer has control of the machine and that is good not such a distraction The only thing we would like to have is a power tailgate which chevy does not offer The lighter color looks nice but shows dirt more and will need washed more often We have captains chairs in the middle which are fixed not removeable the jury is still out on this as we havent had to remove them or not yet Our last van we took them out once in 4yrs Overall we are happy with our new van
0,When you drive this BMW you know that a great deal of effort went into every facet of the automobile The way each sound the reaches your ears and the car reacts to bumps and especially the way it drives down the road Ive had this car for about 18 months and 16000 miles Each mile is a pleasure and every drive is too short Xdrive is great in snow and rain idrive is still revealing new functions but works well for me but the standard radio is just ok Standard seats are comfortable for hours on end Highway driving is smooth and quiet very easy to cruise at high speeds Ive leased this car and really do not want to ever give it back Just do it you only live once
1,I have had my 300 for the past two years Traded in my Chevy Tahoe for this car So far my car has had both fuel tank problems The parts were very hard to find and Chrysler Inc did not want to take any responsibility Chrysler personnel have very poor customer skills and a very poor customer service both at the dealer and at the manufacturer Car has run out of gas several times with the fuel gauge showing over 14 of a tank Dealer and Manufacturer have seen nothing wrong and released this car to me I have ran out of gas in this vehicle at least 5 times and sometimes on the freeway The support for this car is horrible
0,Definitely the best vehicle I have ever owned I used to drive Hondas and Toyotas but owning a 5 series really opened my eyes to the reasons that make so many people want to keep buying these even with a hefty price tag
1,The only major complaint I would have with the Chrysler 300 is the thunk you feel when you slowly take off from a light and you hear a hard thunk as though someone has hit you from the rear The thunk sound also occurs when you are trying to reverse the vehicle The Salesman along with Chrysler repair man says that Chrysler is aware of the thunk sound and that is has something to do with the Tranny and since the car has 3 computerized components each components has different functions and they are playing catch up to each other when you hear that slight thunk
0,Outstanding vehicle Fun to drive and great fuel mileage Only gripes are the cup holder and ability to see front and back of the car in tight areas Kudos BMW
1,My 300 is a great car for me and I am very happy I decided on this over some others I looked at foreign and domestic cars in this class but ultimately chose the 300 with the price the final decider I am very satisfied with the 35 V6 and the mpg savings over the hemi makes it a worthwhile choice for me It is very roomy and comfortable Pleasure to drive not a sports car but fun Extremely quiet inside even at 85 mph At first I was afraid the chopped look meant poor visibility but not the case My former car was an Aurora and I miss its oomph but I dont miss the low mpg high maintenance cost and amenities that were an annoyance at times
0,This car is unique and I cannot describe how you feel when you drive it You must own one and drive it on a regular basis to understand
1,I had owned 4 new Cadillacs before buying the 300 and its every bit as good a car for about  dollar10000 less but with a little more punch but not quite the mileage with the Hemi I hope the new owners of Chrysler keep it up Ill buy another
0,This is the best car I have owned The car is very comfortable Good space Runs very smooth Quick acceleration Good quality materials I would recommend this car to anyone Its worth it in the long run I actually like the iDrive I havent had any problems getting it to work This car is hot
1,From the first minute you can feel the Benz quality buried in the architecture of the car Twenty or thirty years from now the turn of the 21st century will be known as the era when Hemi 300s and Chargers ruled the roads You can not buy a better car for the money the closest thing I would trade mine for is a 7 series BMW
0,This is the first BMW that Ive owned My most recent cars were Jaguar and Infinity Overall I am pleased with my choice The styling and handling are excellent
1,Great looking car We looked at Lexus IS and Cadillac CTS and this was the biggest car of the three This car looks and feels very luxious Although its not a Bentley is looks like one from the front
0,Bought my first BMW 530i wSport Package and navigation one month ago to get style plus sporty performance Had driven Nissan Maximas for prior 12 years This car has delivered as Im inventing reasons to take the long way home Went on a 300 mile trip and it was extremely comfortable Interior build quality mechanical and electronic performance is very solid The sport package with 18 low profile tires is a must as it really sets off the look and you get added handling
1,Cupholder location is poorly designed difficult to learn the switches Auto lights should come on with wipers on intermittent not just full speed My drivers side door will not stay open Tired of getting beaten up every time I get in or out of vehicle Comfort A eye catching A
0,Probably the finest car I have ever owned Fun to drive great engineering and outstanding performance Highly recommend to anyone
1,Bought the first 300 in Nov 06 At 429 miles I realized there were serious problems which the dealer said were not problems but normal driving At 650 miles they finally replaced with a new car At 449 miles it started doing the same thing the other had done Took it in   and the dealer said it was the Torque Converter and replaced that Now it has a shimmy and bumps along the road HATE THE CAR
0,Over the years Ive owned many BMW products 7s 5s X5s 2002 and on and on None of them can match this particular car it is truly incredible At first I was not sure about the Bangle styling but I have to admit that as the car has aged it has really grown on me and I now love the styling It will run with a Porsche 911 without problem and on a cruise from Florida to Michigan it was superb The car is almost a year old and has never had a single problem nor been back to the dealership To quote Lee Iacocca if you can find a better car buy it
1,compared to my LHS this is a farce the seats are hard the ac is weak the trunk will carry mini bags 2 golf bags and it is full the fuel rating is not true it is horrible have owned LHS 2 models and other chrysler models since 70s this is really a sad car looks good from the outside but that is where is where I say it ends
0,I bought this car after owning other luxury cars It outranks the others by far The handling and solid ride speaks volumes The downside is it is so smooth on the open road you have to watch the speed  it is moving faster than it feels Quality and handling along with style One small issue is that the cup holder needs to be redesigned its not in a good place I am totally sold all my cars in the future will be BMW
1,I leased a 2007 300C AWD after coming off a two year lease on a 2005 Cadillac STS Best move I ever made The design in Inferno Red is a real head turner The power and interior comfort cant be matched With the options I took I have very feature I could want at an unbelievable low price
0,Im a long term Audi owner have had six who decided to look around when they dropped the free maintenance I test drove the new Audi A6 wagon and the BMW 530xiT The BMW did just about everything better than the Audi and the monthly lease rate was better The choice was a nobrainer The 530xiT ride and handling are first rate as is the build quality The engine is exceptionaly smooth but could use a bit more low end torque Winter performance especially with snow tires is exceptional The iDrive is not as scary as expected but could be better I like my BMW so much that we replaced my wifes Audi with a BMW 530xiT too
1,I had to get this car because my company went to company cars I was driving an 05 Acura TSX The 300 that I have has the ABS and the side curtain air bags The base motor is just not powerful enough I would have preferred the 35 motor but it was not an option
0,My 2007 530xi is the most beautiful car I have ever owned the fit and finish is excellent the interior is clean roomy and above all its comfortable The nav system is great logic 7 sound system is crisp and clear auto trans is very smooth Car is loaded with just about everything Can no longer see myself ever driving any other car ever again
1,We love our Aspen it handles well and the bells and whistles are awesome We havent had any malfunctions to speak of although my husband has noticed something strange at the pumps he often fills up when the needle is on E and as he fills the tank he expects the gallons on the pump to match what he knows the tank should hold the numbers come close to matching Its as if theres a few unrecorded gallons left in his tank but its a significant amt The dealer has checked it out too and no one can explain it Its weird Our one complaint the rear seats are FIXED They cannot be slid forward or backward by the occupant to accommodate a tall driver or someone in the 3rd row
0,Its been over 12 years since my last bimmer Theres lots of new technology but most importantly the funtodrive factor is still there Adequate power from the 215hp very comfortable ride solid feeling car Only two disappointments are the Nav and interior storage Severely outdated and lacking basic function of searchbyname Who decided to leave this out Interior storage is minimal Space in center armrest is laughable Those gripes aside this is a great car
1,This is an excellent SUV for the Price The limited has all the features other similar SUVs have at a lower cost Unfortunately the vehicle has been in the service department 4 times because the engine malfunction light comes on and causes the vehicle to have drivability issues I have been to 2 different dealerships and nobody can find the cause of the issue which has caused a serious safety issue Be cautious about buying this new model
0,After driving everything in the luxury sedan market in the  dollar4565K range this car won me over Unlike the Lexus GS 350 this car has a real trunk way more fun to drive than anything in its price range The hushed cabin at high speed puts Lexus and Infinti to shame combined with incredible handling Dont pass up the chance to try one of these cars Thumbs way up
1,This SUV is fanatastic I had an Expedition for a little while a couple of years ago but quickly traded it in because it felt and drove like a truck The Aspen is a dream I traded in my Pacifica which I loved for a little more room Initially I was worried about the ride but that was needless It drives and feels like a car
0,This car is a dream come true Living in New England I was starting to accept the idea that I would have to drive an SUV This car saved me I love driving it and for the first time ever I cant wait for the next snow storm I was considering the Lexus 350 AWD NO COMPARISON If you drive this car you will fall in love Period
1,Wow I am still having fun driving this beast after one year I own a 57 hemi limited all equipped except for the NAV I believed that all reviews are pretty accurate However I will comment on Canadian winter driving with lot of snows freezing rains icy conditions the driving is OK with the 20 tires but would strongly recommend winter tires but hard to find This is my 1st year with winter tires and nothing can stop me The 4 wheel drives is extremely precise and can not feel anything when all wheels are slipping My wife kids and I feel extremely safe in the vehicle
0,After 16 years of owning BMWs bought an 03 MB SL500 drove it for 2 months traded it in for my 2007 550i No comparison yes different car but the 550i truly outperformed in all areas Lets start with peace of mind with BMWs bumper to bumper warranty smooth transmission more than ample power 367 hp luxurious interior   and amenities iDrive is not bad once you get use to it bluetooth nav display is wide   and split screen for other features tons of improvement from prior models too much to list running out of space Its the Ultimate Driving Machine and nothing in its class compares
1,My wife and I just bought the Aspen This thing rocks We got the HEMI DVD NAV leather heated seats and so on We bought this as a lease return and noticed the fuel is a little poor but it is a big suv with lots of power Everyone who has seen it has loved the interior and the exterior as well Mention it has a HEMI and they say wow The gas mileage is about 16 mpg in rush hour traffic not to bad
0,I leased a 530 when the 335 felt surprisingly small The ride of the car is great and the quality of materials used in the cabin are great I really wanted the hifi audio but could not find a car with it I can see why as the stock system is great far exceeding my expectations the 30L engine is very capable and handles all speeds very well
1,This SUV is the bomb I get compliment after compliment on it Its loaded and I feel rich driving it It came with a lifetime powertrain warranty however I purchased the extended bumper to bumper warranty which is lifetime as well Yes I said lifetime bumber to bumper What can I say I have had past problems with American made vehicles Although I doubt it will give me as many problems as my Chevy Trailblazer and Buick Rendezvous That Hemi just hums You will be noticed and you cant beat the priceperiod
0,Ive had the 2007 530i with manual transmission for about a month What a great car Test drove the automatic but it wasnt quite as fun to drive The handling ride quality and acceleration simply brings a huge smile on my face Like other reviewers I always take the long way home I have owned Lexus and Volvo and there is no comparison This is truly a drivers car If you really enjoy driving this is your car Also I am averaging 285 mpg combined driving another plus for getting the manual transmission
1,This is not a pretend SUV I have owned SUVs for 15 years and watched them become watereddown shadows of themselves In 02 got a new Suburban loved it but GM has done nothing significant with style or powerplant Chrysler has shown they can combine rugged performance and styling to come up with a vehicle that performs and is appealing to the eye GM and Ford have allowed their large SUVs to become oafish by comparison Their design teams just do not get it in my opinion Europe and Japan arent making anything comparable for under  dollar70k
0,This is my second BMW It doesnt get any better than this Wonderful ride muscle and luxury in one beautiful package
1,Purchased last month and paid 4000 off sticker Great ride and cornering I tow a snowmobile trailer and it tugs it like you dont know whats behind you I pack in 8 adults and threw the kids in it yesterday at school What a great allround suv built by Daimler Chrysler
0,My husband just bought this car and I fell in love with it the moment I got into it Such an attractive vehicle and it drives beautifully I dont know a lot about cars but I have driven a Jaguar Mercedes Land Rover and Volvo and none of them comes close
1,Has the look of a Pacifica with the room of a suv Design similarities like the ribbed hood have crossed over from the crossfire Handles well not sluggish and does not wallow like some big suvs Will tow my boat as well as haul my kids their friends and the dogs Am very happy with it
0,I have owned several Mercedes and thought I would never switch I went to get another Mercedes and their emphasis on cost cutting is apparent I drove the 530xi and was blown away Interior appointments are outstanding fit and finish exceptional and the driving experience is beyond compare This car is absolutely dead stable and nearly silent at 130 mph with amazing handling even in heavy rain You can get an EClass Mercedes for less but there is just no comparison The 530xi is worth the few extra bucks  it is clear that this is still a pure German built vehicle like Porsche
1,The car has been an eye turner from day one Chrysler did an overthetop job in building it I have more people coment on it Fast sporty great lookingsexy Look into it you wont regret it
0,A drive in the 550i is an experience of quality satisfaction and exclusivity Superior handling and braking comfortable and refined interior runflat tires Harman Kardon Logic 7 system sports 13 speakers including two subwoofers surround sound simulation Digital Sound Processing DSP
1,i purchased my pacifica from carmax in raleigh and it has been nothing but trouble i purchased it on 16 aug 09 and it has been in the shop 4 times and this last time they still dont know whats wrong with it each time i took it to be repaired the techs kept telling me the noises were normal it took the sup of service to ride with me to tell them the noises werent normal the car has been with them more than with me maybe they should be making the payment
0,Picked up in Munich and hit the Autobahn although keeping breakin RPMs below 4500 was still able to enjoy high speed cruising Ended in Naples with 1250 miles a week later Delivered to USA in early November Currently 6500 miles and enjoying more every day This is a unique car after driving 1995 Audi S6 for ten years 175000 miles this car had to please me alot So far it has delivered No real issues although iDrive technology learning curve is initially steep Mounted snow tires on new wheels to blast around this winter and cant wait to return to summer driving conditions Likely the best ride for the sporty minded sedan generation
1,Purchased the Pacifica used with 5900 miles on it Nothing but trouble We owned two 05s and they were good one great one fair We liked the car THEN the tyranny started bucking Would not down shift when going up an incline Not fixed we were told this is a problem with the Pacifica Motor mounts four sets in 20000 miles The dealer says this is normal and a better mount has not been designed because the Pacifica has been discontinued Good luck when the warranty is up The trim has all but three pieces has been replaced and is spotting again The drivers seat shreds the seat cushion when the seat motor is engaged AWFUL NOW a noise is starting to come in the front suspension
0,I bought my 550i just a few weeks ago and what an incredible ride that car let me tell you Not only is it POWERFUL putting you back in your seat but it stops on a dime Having a racing background I can tell you that you need to get the 5 series for its handling and power delivery Everything else just about is a plus The monster power in the 550i is invigorating Have fun Please just make sure that the Homelink garage door opener works before you drive it off the dealer Mine needed to be changed 3 days later
1,I have owned my Pacifica for almost two years and it has never had to go back to the dealer I give it regular maintenance and it drives like a dream I use the car for everything and I average about 22 mpg Not too many long hauls in Hawaii It gets up to speed quickly and stops quickly and straight I have experienced the chatter of the trans between 1st and 2nd and 2nd and 1st at slow speed and that Chrysler cure was a flash to the engine computer I have not taken it to the dealer as I dont want it to end up worse than it started I have not had the opportunity to speak to other owners as Pacificas are not that prevalent here
0,Im 41 with two kids This is the perfect car for me it is fun to drive in any situation There is plenty of room for all the hockey equipment I have not had one problem with the car
1,One week after purchasing my 2007 Pacifica we had to have the drive train replaced A while later it was lunging forward and jerking at times when accelerating Dealer could not find anything wrong Took it back several times before they finally found the problem It has been in for transmission repairs 4 times Last week when I went to take my kids to school it would not move The emergency brake spring broke and shot through my rear brake ABS light and traction control problems are constant Look up complaints on the Pacifica and you will find out a lot I would never purchase a Chrysler vehicle again I do not feel like my family is safe in this car
0,This 2007 is a replacement for my 2003 5 series I thought the 2003 was the finest car I had drivenThe 2007 is so much better in every way Also iDrive is quite easy if you take the time and read the directions and practice using it in your garage
1,I agree with many of the reviews that I read the car is a great design however at 10000 miles this car lost it The transmission was clunky and with several transmission upgrades it seems to just keep coming back as many of the others It has broken down twice due to a gas gauge tank problems as I am learning a not so rare issue For this it is unreliable After numerous trips to the dealer it still happens I am tired of it Why would this car come with a 6 disc DVD changer and no screen Broken motor mounts also common in the 2007
0,The car is wonderful I picked it up in Munich as part of BMWs European Delivery Program and subsequently drove it 1000 miles on the Autobahn throughout Germany and Austria this past December It cruises at 130 mph just as easily as it does at 65 or 70 mph It is actually more comfortable to drive at higher speeds As with my past BMW it has a tendancy to want to pull you faster down the road  like a race horse always wanting to go ever faster  be careful to keep an eye on the speedometer The interior is very nicely appointed and well equipped The iDrive is not as cumbersome as others have claimed I think the iDrive becomes an issue for those drivers who are not tech savvy
1,The complete buying experience was awful Problems right from the start between the transmission front end reversing AWD It was endless and the dealerships were not helpful in the least Currently involved in Lemon law case with vehicle
0,Great car You will not be disappointed Solid handling fun to drive great stereo and I love the Sirius radio A drivers car What more could you ask for Will definitely be a repeat customer Take the plunge
1,At 22000 miles new problem with auto control of head lights  set on auto they do not go off set on auto the are on in daylight set on manual off they dont go off for 23 minutes
0,I bought this 530i to replace another luxury sedan Riding in the 530i is incomparable you feel like a billion bucks well at least a million Go compare a test drive with other luxury autos youll feel the difference In the end all else is just not a BMW and you get what you pay for
1,Bought the car for my wife and three kids  Over look of car great  Big issues hear AWD  car just shut off on a highway with my three kids in the car  And would not stay running for more than one minute  Dealer sent me over the edge No help at all  This first and last Chrysler Ill ever buy  After talking to some other owners have had same problems  Upset in DAD PA
0,Very fun to drive and big enough for me inside I am 64 I love driving this car Literally I take the long way home
1,I bought this car after testing it in Canada for two weeks under severe weather conditions It is the best overall car that I have owned so far My friends and myself dont understand why Chryslers new owners want to stop production I think they dont know how to market the good product they make and they havent listen to us their customers
0,The 2007 BMW 525i is a blast to drive with good gas mileage Handles like a race car and is still has plenty of luxury to it A buy all day long
1,The title of my comments says it all I dont understand why these didnt sell well I know Chrysler didnt market them well but Ive had an S class Mercedes a 540 BMW and 40 other cars and this is my favorite It is great on fuel if you consider its 2 12 tons and gets 30 mpg on the highway and about 20 in the city Ive just finished a trip to New England and the miles are effortless and Im over 60 years old Id recommend one to anyone
0,This is the first BMW I have bought The car looks and rides better then any of the other cars I have owned 12 over the past 25 years It may be a little high for most budgets but you will not be disapointed Worth every penny I only got Aust and had to have the navigation The car is packed with features without spending tons on options Completely satisfied with the performance on the basic 215 HP 525i
1,This is my second Pacifica My first was a 2005 and loved it My wifes girl friend wanted it so bad that I sold it to her and bought a 2007 Signature Series model The ride comfort and features are great I am getting an average of 21 mpg combined Chrysler is making a huge mistake discontinuing this model
0,After owning a Lexus since 1998 GS 400 and LS 430 I test drove the BMW for its renowned sports feel There is no comparison For a youthful yet practical drive this is the top choice The All Wheel capabilities allow a sports car in Northeast winters I love to drive this car and there is plenty of room for two kids and two dogs
1,Test drove 2005   and 2006 models before falling for the 2007 model with 40 and six speed automatic Bought a fleet car with 24000 Just finished a 2500 mile trip Average city MPG is 185 and 26 MPG on the highway doing 75 Would get 32 if I kept it at 6065 10 percent ethanol cuts mileage by 1020 percent Tons of room in front and 2nd row Acceleration is great Havent driven in the snow but dont have any worries based on experience to date It has the capacity of full size SUV with gas mileage of midsized sedan
0,Great car for the working mom driving 60 miles a day Great performance lots of fun and plenty of room in the back seat for a car seat as well as a booster seat I plan on being a BMW owner for life
1,Purchased this vehicle for my Father and Mother Dad and Mom are at 80 this year and I noticed them having trouble getting in and out of their old car They looked and drove other makes but decided on the 300 When we got to the dealership I asked them to look at the Pacifica He fell in love with it and damn those SUVs on the road I cant see around them attitude was a thing of the past Moms quote Its so big I dont like it They have since driven to PA on a trip and Mom now on her 1 millionth trip to the store loves being up there They still smile when I ask them hows the car now
0,I love this car The iDrive is not that hard to use It has nothing to do with the drive or handling The 525 has enough power for all every day around town duties On the road it is a dream 30 MPG last trip
1,Blame myself for buying but Chrysler also guilty Was dusk and raining so didnt look closely at delivery Over next few days driving and inspecting was increasingly disappointed Exterior paint looked like red orange peel Almost every body seam not straight Interior center console dash door panels have large gaps and not aligned Leather seats have puckering on seams and easily scuffed Rattles from center console and dash Speakers rattle and have very noticeable distortion Steering wheel not aligned When accelerating has loud exhaust roar Transmission jerky when shifting Poor fuel economy Impossible to drive with either one or both rear windows down has loud pulsating buffeting airflow
0,This is the 3rd BMW that I owned second 5 series This is one sweet car Mine is black wbrick color interior BMWs are reliable and fun to drive and are SAFE Plenty of room in car and trunk
1,The pacifica is NOT a car and is NOT an suvand definitely is NOT A MINI VANif anything at all it leans more towards a luxury suv I LOVE IT
0,This is the first bimmer I have owned and it will not be the last unless I keep this one forever The car drives and handles great and is a pleasure to operate I also feel very safe in my bimmer The car is very well insulated and outside noise is almost unheard I purchased the premium sound system and love it The iDrive was a little daunting to begin with but I have mastered it and if I can do it anybody can I would highly recommend this car to anyone
1,Very upset with this purchase Have only had a few months and my engine light is on Today as I drove it it started bucking wouldnt go over 30 mph Ive read many reviews today about this being a common problem another site The dealer cant get me in today so Im SOL I am paying quite a bit for this car and having it for such a short amount of time and this is wrong Not happy
0,Im so happy that I got this car I owned famous brands like Lexus Toyota Honda Nissan before and nothing can compare to this vehicle The drive is stable and performance is great
1,I bought this car for a franchise that I later sold but kept the car At 20K miles it needed new brake pads   and rotors and again at 40K miles The AC compressor died at 30K Now the check engine light is coming on and it is driving very rough There is only 40K miles on this car folks I would never have bought a Chrysler if it was not the car of choice for the franchise I owned at the time and will NEVER buy one again
0,Car drives great smoother and quieter than 2003 530 Switched to automatic sport mode takes a while to get used to but pretty good Suspension best Ive ever driven Absorbs most bumps but stays tight in turns Havent driven in snow yet
1,I am retired Great carsuv for short trips Entry comfort is perfectstyle has no equal No mechanical problems Cheap to buy and maintain and insure Production has ended at the end of 2009 Parts will be available for years I think Chrysler made a mistake in getting rid of this one HHR sales have never equaled PTs This carsuv will be a retro classic and we all want to go back to the past
0,I love the drive and acceleration in this car Feels like riding on a cloud when you put this car on the highway Has good sound insulation and of course that classic handsome look of the BMW The standard stereo system is great with good sound quality
1,I always loved the look of the PT so I broke down and bought one in 2007 Since my purchase have had it in the shop 4 times for check engine light and now I am having to replace the brakes and rotors and barely have 20K miles Service personnel said they have had this trouble with the PT Cruisers Why didnt they tell me that when I bought it No wonder Chrysler is needing a bailout when they make such bad cars I have never bought a new car that needed any major mechanical work before 30K and most didnt need work until 60K miles I am very disappointed in this car and will never buy a Chrysler again
0,This car is amazing which for the price it should be It is however living up to every expectation I dont know how I ever drove anything else
1,Have had this PTC for about 2 mos It was a previously owned rental vehicle and was in very good condition in and out It rides smoothly has a nice road feel and get around 25 mpg overall Its not a very economical city driver below 20 mpg but most folks like me use primarily highway I get people commenting about it all the time TheyI like the styling the convertible looks much nicer than the sedan the color opal and the fact that is can seat passengers in the backseat with reasonable comfort The trunk is a bit small but slightly above average for a convertible The 16 alloy wheels are sharp but I will soon replace the Goodyear tires  which are awful
0,This is my 4th BMW and I have never been disappointed It wasnt until the new 07 525 that I was actually blown away It is light years ahead of my old 528 All the new electronics voice activation navigation iDrive iPod bluetooth are worth every penny especially if you use your car as your mobile office
1,Weirdest thing EVER If a drop of water gets on the seats it leaves a watermark Ive had my car for only a few months and the interior looks terrible I tried to clean it and that only made it worse Wherever the cleaner went it left a watermark stain
0,I love the drive acceleration the grip feeling that gives when you are getting into curves
1,do not try to put chains on thiswill hydro plane too easy with these tirescant change tire sizeno clarince beware this can kill blind spot to rear left   and right 22 mpg at60 mph 185 cityneeds lots of room to turn no lock abillity 4 small stuff
0,My 550I is fun to drive especially on the open road Gas mileage in city driving is on the low side freeway driving is excellent Vehicle comfort and handling is excellent Performance is excellent The heads up display needs improvement my 2001 Corvettes C5 heads up display is by far superior Stylingalways gets head turning
1,This car has by far the worst gas mileage in the CITY that I have ever experience in my life I used to have an 84 Chevy Caprice Wagon Estate and it got better gas mileage and was a more comfortable ride For shorter people like me I am 5 foot 3 the car is extra roomy but for someone a little bit taller I would be a little bit concerned in the front seats I simply hate this vehicle and I cant wait for them to repo it Its not even worth paying for any more I am just going to take the hit to my credit and move on amicably They will just write it off as a loss and sell my debt to a collections agency anyways I have never in my life been disgusted with a vehicle until now
0,Great car  got the manual transmission  full loaded  fun to drive iDrive complicated but easily learned  just need to sit with the book Only downside thus far is Nav System  I found the maps to be outdated when compared with my Garmin C330 GPS  interestingly both BMW and Garmin get their maps from the same source Navteq Hoping a new and better map will come along soon This is a peppy and fun car to drive Cant wait to test the AWD in the winter Highly recommend the stick shift
1,I got my 2007 PT Crusier from a private car broker after I had got into a car accident in my 2000 Toyota Camry in Feb Now Im a tall girl and my head hits the ceiling if I dont have the seats laid back I am the claustrophobic type   and since the ceiling also slants more down in the front that causes a problem for me too The drive is a little more rough when I compare it to my old Camry The PT does not have little cubbies like my Camry did and you sit very high up in the car to the point that you think youre driving a truck The back seats have great head room though but the leg room is quite small Its December now and Im trading in my PT Hopefully tomorrow cause Im sick of driving it
0,I traded my 2003 745Li for the new 2007 530i I wanted and got a sedan that is sporty and fun to drive with great overall performanceroad feel Both exterior and interior design stand out against everything in its price range IDrive is simplified vs my tradein and not a problem to use Driving this car is what sells it and makes my daily 50 mile commute something to look forward to
1,Wow Horrible gas mileage I seriously thought there was something wrong with it when I got it but apparently its in working order How can I get 14 MPG in town in 4 cyl and only 2224 highway Please I would expect this mileage from a mid to large size SUV not a car This car needless to say is gone or on its way out Its not that the features or styling that I dont like which I do but when youre driving 150300 miles per day yea filling that puppy up everyday is just putting to many read numbers in quick book for me
0,Exceeds my expectations I do a lot of highway driving Averaging over 29 MPG with about 20 on the local roads This car is not only fast but comfortable as well I focused on getting the colors I wanted Monoco Blue and beige interior I did not want nor bought all the extras just the winter package and navigation This car can zoom when I need the speed to pass Cruising is awesome with navigation and the standard sound system which is excellent The dealer did a great job on the presale and delivery and whats wrong with 4 years of free maintenance
1,This viehicle had to have two front transmission seals replaced before it had 2400 miles on it yes two thousand four hundred miles This vehicle vibrates at 45mph and while in idle Very disappointed in vehicle and reliability Brakes shutter at breaking at high speed will be a problem at a later date
0,Fit and finish is top notch Handling and comfort are exceptional The split screen LCD used for iDrive and NAV is bright widescreen format and of high resolution The iDrive is fine once you get used to it
1,The mileage is just awful How could a 4 cyl compact car in 07 get such bad mileage Shame on you Chrysler I have under 20K Mi and have been to the dealer 4 times My PT stalled out on me 2 times Embarassing for a new car Check Eng light came on and off regularly finally it was diagnosed as oxygen sensor Clear lens on dash developed 2 cracks AC made noise when recurculate was turned on and off All fixed politely by my accomodating dealer however it is a hassle I dread long term reliability and would sell right now if not for huge loss Front seats have stains from water spills Should have gone for the HHR for the extra 34K  dollar I do not recomend this car
0,I just bought the 550i after looking around for a few months I wanted the performance but I was concerned about the fuel economy If you can believe the gauge on the car I am getting 286 MPG on the highway It is only rated at 25 so that is excellent When I fill it up again I will verify that number This car is a pleasure to drive Its quick quiet and comfortable Sport package not necessary Automatic is best for most There is a 1300 dollar gas guzzler tax on the stick shift
1,I bought this 2007 Chrysler sebring in 2997 with 25000 miles on it And this car has given me a lot of surprises and upsets First in less than 1 year there were 2 recalls on the car than just a few months a go the check engine light went on and now just 2 days a go it started over heating I took it to the dealer but they couldnt find anything This car is full of surprises in less than 2 years now and I am fed up with this This might be the worst car that I ever had with this kind of problem I only drive 30 miles a day and things like this is kinda considered stupid for Chrysler Dont buy this car it only looks good but bad performance
0,The car is smooth as silk at idle has a muscular power curve It has power from the word go and handles like a dream the AC works far superior than BMW units have in the past The sport package is a must the front seats are a dream The iPod aux input adapter works great Gets 25 mpg on the highway It feels and drives like a sports car there are still no substitutions for a BMW
1,This car I call the American version of the Yugo In the six months my wife has had this car the serpentine belt has been replaced three times the air conditioner compressor has been replaced twice the gear shift stuck in park when she parked on a slight incline the front bumper has separated from the panels above because it is attached with flimsy bolts The panel under the motor is missing probably fell off on the highway somewhere The interior is cheap plastic noisy when it idles Chrysler has been bailed out twice by the American taxpayer Why They cant sell junk cars
0,Just traded in a twoyear old 3series for the new 530i I love it Am really enjoying the car
1,Car stalls randomly when stopped Dealer can find nothing wrong Car occasionally drivings at 5000 RPM when doing only about 60 MPH Again dealer can find no cause says there is no code so they cant help you Offered me the option to turn it into the bank or use it as a trade less than 1 year later for greatly less than I paid Would NEVER purchase form this dealer or this car EVER again
0,Car is as described It is a drivers car with power performance and luxury amenities It is more than I expected
1,i have had this car for almost 2 years now when i was first going to buy a car for my wife i test drove many other models in the midsized sedan market this one stood out for a few reasons a great stereo and a long list of features this is the touring 24 liter model first anyone who buys a car for reliability doesnt love cars or even car they just want it to run so dont right a review this car has had not had a single problem dont drive it like you stole it and service it and it shouldnt this car was cheaper than any of the other makes and looks way more expensive it has more features and if you arent reviewing the car like ze Germans then then you realize this is a nice car
0,This is my first BMW and it is fun Everything from the exterior styling to the driving characteristics are great The iDrive system does take a little time to master but allows you to program many things that other cars do not The car is getting well over the average miles per gallon in city traffic
1,Do not get me wrong this is a really good car the only issue I have with it is the brakes It seems that the braking system is not strong enough for the car now that might be how they make cars today but its not smart I found out that I needed brakes at around 10000 miles when I went to stop and the vehicle did not want to and then you heard a horrible grinding noise only to find out that there was nothing left to the pads they had worn down with no notification whatsoever some saftey light would have been nice Just something to consider
0,Bought the car on military sales overseas nice price with a 3k rebate just under 53K fully optioned no HUDauto cruise but NVD etc No glitches drives wonderfully
1,I purchased my 07 Sebring new and put 25K miles in one year In this time it only needed one minor fix to the trunk release I have the 24l 4 cyl and no issues with pep Im a bit surprised by some reviews that report lack of pep I travel a lot and have driven many rental cars with 4 cyl engines I dont think any of them have as much go or more power than my Sebring On the highway its quite and handles far better than I expected for the price I paid On one recent highway trip I got 35 mpg doing mostly 70 mph My only concern is if Chrysler will stay in business to honor the life time power train warranty that came with my car for no extra cost
0,Awesome power and ride with the sport package option suspension and Dunlop run flat tires Very smooth even on rough roads Comfort seats are amazing Premium sound is a must due to amazing logic 7 system No problems at all nothing to even adjust The iDrive is no problem once you get used to it
1,I leased my Sebring when they were brand new to the showrooms It was a great car that handled well has great features like Sirius satellite radio 6 in dash CD player and most importantly UConnect I found it so much easier to use than the Trailblazer I had The four cylinder engine had more than enough power to take us where we were going and in the year and a half I had the car no problems to report The greatest concern with the car is safety The car was in an accident which rendered it a complete loss The car was hit head on and the air bags never went off Thankfully my children werent in the car but I did suffer chest pain from hitting the steering wheel
0,This is by far the best BMW I have ever owned This is my seventh BMW ranging from 94 750il 95 325is 97 M3 99 540i 02 Z4 and 04 745li This cars performance matches many sports cars
1,I saw this car I thought wow this is a really nice car I like this I took it for a drive I seemed to really like the feel of the car and was really impressed with the car for the price What a mistake I have had nothing but trouble I have had 4 water leaks in my car and I dont mean little I mean about two inches of water in there After the fourth time of this they think they have it fixed My air conditioning has gone out twice and my blinkers blink even when they are not in use My windshield wipers are tearing up my windshield for the third time as well I know you are thinking oh she just got a lemon well the dealer said this is about the 15 car with the same problems
0,The car was delivered 3 weeks ago and then I took my wife and son on a trip to Maine covering 3000 miles We spent a lot of time in the car and it was worth every penny we paid for it Its a dream on the highway and a pleasure in the mountains The handling was classic BMW and driving was a pleasure I recommend the navigation system for anyone who travels much away from home It was very useful and easy to use Ive heard complaints about the iDrive but after a very short time it became very easy to use Ive had two 3 series cars and I enjoyed them This is a great step up
1,I have had this car for about 46 months   and have had it to the shop a lot for electrical problems   and broken seal on the radiator overflow It is still under factory warranty as it only had 19000 miles on it when I got it Carfax had no bad reports on it at all I am concerned about the electrical problems as they have had to replace the battery   and 2 different electrical modules with the low number of miles on this I am wondering what else might happen It was a one owner car from Alaska   and there are no records to see what problems they had Do you think I might have a lemon John
0,Incredible automobile The 48 liter has smooth power delivery automatic transmission is good match Great for commuting canyon carving and street races A real sleeper can out accelerate nearly any vehicle on the road and do it with style while carrying several passengers Luxury features are fantastic iDrive very convenient once mastered Navigation system is excellent Logic7 sound system is incredible 20way seats are extraordinary This is a real drivers car 525 and 530 do not even compare The 550i in different league very much worth the 20k premium 060 mph in 5 seconds and the quarter mile in 13 seconds encapsulated in a very luxurious cabin the only way to travel
1,This is the worst car ever I have had nothing but problems since I got it The dealership where I got it is horrible Not friendly at all Way too many problems There is a long list I believe that I have had 3 alternators within 3 months of having the car I would not recommend it I dont care what other people are saying about it The worst car ever
0,BMW has created an outstanding sport sedan The combination of luxury and driving dynamics are hard to beat We purchased this vehicle as a sport sedan alternative to an SUV for getting from the Bay Area up to Tahoe So far we love the vehicle We have no knocks in iDrive If you have used a computer mouse you should have no problem
1,Im a proud FORD owner however my family works at JEEP and I get the EC discount I leased my Sebring for 159 a month and the 2006 model is VERY boring This 2007 model grabs from the 300C and the Crossfire Its very affordable The people that dont like this car because they want BMW or AUDI style and performance and want to pay like a KIA Seriously give this car a try this comes from a FORD person FYI go for the V6 its much better
0,This car lives up to its title Ultimate Driving Machine Fun to drive plenty of power and highly accurate steering The interior ride and comfort is second to none The navigation system and radio are a dream because of their ease of use I would highly recommend this car
1,The engineers at Chrysler should have taken a little more time in over hauling this car More thought could have made this car more elegant The interior could have been made a little less retro disco era and they could have give us more leg room and more comfortable seats The 27 engine has no get up and go They could have easily had to options the 4 cylinder or the other 6 cylidar the 27 is not necessary Also the moon roof could have been a little bit bigger Being that the 300 M   and Concords were eliminated they really could have done better with the quality
0,Just traded an 04 530i SP PP Auto Titanium GrayGray clear hood bra for an 07 530i SP PP Auto Rear Sunshades Logic7 stereo Monaco BlueBeige clear hood bra I continue to love the exterior design The extra hp in the 2007 is noticeable The stereo upgrade was worth it The rear sunshades are a real nice classy touch The Monaco Blue is a deep rich blue The Bridgestone runflats in the 2007 are a MAJOR improvement over the Dunlop runflats in the 2004 Did not get active steering on the 2007  more turns of the wheel but better feel for the road Still getting used to the comfort seats standard on 2007 SP but I think I will like them better than sport seats on 2004
1,I bought this car 3 weeks ago and absolutely hate it Its the worse piece of crap I have ever rodedroveThe seats are cheap and very uncomfortable and there is little if no leg room or hip room If you are over 5 5 forget you have no head room I feel very confined sitting in this carThe dash is made of this nasty cheap plastic with a silver tin accent and looks like hellThe moon roof is not very big compared to my other car and even thou I have the 27 v6 engine it is still sluggish The head rest in the front seats are at an awkward angle so that you feel like your head is constantly being pushed forward Its gas mileage is very good Chrysler should dump this and bring back the 300 M
0,Well balanced and fun to drive I bought a US spec car in Europe at the Military discount Very well equipped for the price Tons of gadgets too many for my wife Drives better than the MB it replaced
1,I will never purchase another Chrysler Honda here I come Tried to support American cars for most of my life This car has me swearing never again Replaced a power window motor the power steering motor and something else with in the steering wheel had 2 bad tires drove with a flatsensor didnt come on replaced brakes at 18K its in now for bad roof leaking in 3 spots and a sunroof rattle Door plates surrounding the power window buttons are rubbing downshowing signs of wear I never use them and so are the seatsI have 25K miles on the van mostly from 3 long trips I havent even had it 2 yrs Bad gas mileage not even 17 MPG Worst car Ive ever owned Poorest quality
0,After owning only American vehicles since 16  I made my first move to a foreign car after I fell in love with the new BMW 5 series styling  Everyone that views the car seems to feel the same I think the 550 i with the larger tires just finishes off the car as I would desire it
1,Leased this vehicle in Feb 07 and just mailed Chrysler the check to purchase it My wife is the principal driver and she loves it She would not even consider getting a new vehicle when the lease is up Went 2 to dealers to look at new vehicles and she walked out because she has her heart set on keeping this vehicle No problems at all The only things done in 2 years of use is oil changes every 3000 miles and front and rear brakes Van is loaded with every option available in the Signature Series The van is extremely practical my only complaint is ITS A MINI VAN
0,We have enjoyed this car so far We DO love the iDrive Has awesome programmable features Very well built car and is very good fit and finish Car is ok on room but wish the back seats had a little more room The 745i had better room but it was a lot more expensive We looked at Audi mercedes Lexus and Infinity My wife fell in love with the overall feel of the car versus the others The drive is very solid and is very tight to drive Free maint was a plus
1,Ive owned quite a few automobilestrucks over the yearsbut this definitely has had the most problemsFirsttransmission rebuild at 13000 milesNow at 27000 miles and the transmission will slap into 2nd gear at low speeds Also tierods replaced at 27000 miles Service adviser said probably because the tie rods were made for cars and couldnt take the weight of the van Ive worked on cars myself and have NEVER seen a tierod go at 27000 miles Check the internet Im not the only oneI know foreign makes have there problems alsobutIm really disappointed in a  dollar32000 vehicle
0,To me this is a big car  just as long and heavy as our full sized minivan Drives very well and easy around town I live in Europe US spec so tons of fun on autobahn Easy driving at 130mph with sleeping wife and two kids Night vision is a hoot but well see how useful it is Owners manual is a tome but worth the read esp the voice command section Once set up iDrive is no issue though my wife has yet to tackle it
1,Cant say enough about this vanHas been excellent since bought crossed the country three times with no problems or discomfort Gass mileage great 30 on hwy 22 city use full synthic oil only and mileage explodes upward Do not regret this buy
0,This car is the best handling and nicest car I have owned It is smooth when accelerating and the handling is impressive The navigation is solid and I did not personally have a issue with the iDrive system Anyone with computer mouse experience and the ability to conquer Microsoft Windows will find the iDrive system easy to use My only advice is to stay away from the Performance Package with the run flat tires if you dont want to feel like your running over a speed bump by just running over a cigarette butt
1,We needed a second vehicle and decided on a mini van After searching internet sources we settle on an 07 T  andC with 15000 miles The day we went to see it a last minute check turned up the same model with only 5000 on it I was skeptical to say the least It turned out to be a Chrysler exec car with 5000 miles and still had the new car showroom smell You cant fake that We love it Our other car is a Caddy Deville and while our van is not a Caddy it is equally comfortable on long trips The gas mileage with under 10000 on it now is better than the CaddyI am getting 2022 mph in town and upwards of 25 on the highway I can only wait until the mileage gets up there and better MPG
0,I was set to buy a Lexus GS 300 AWD until I drove the 530xi It is a great but expensive car Also drove the Audi A6 Infiniti M35AWD and Acura RL The handling is superb and the attention to detail is appreciated Long live iDrive  for me it is like using a mouse or joystick No more fumbling for the correct button or the proper position on a touch screen Should have listened to the owners forums and ordered the Head Up Display
1,So I had to replace both electric motors on sliding doors also both tie rod ends both front wheel brake pads and I only got 20000 miles on it Ive never seen such poor workmanship on a new vehicle No wonder Chrysler cannot compete with the competition
0,The car is solid but the front seat is a bit deep and the back of your legs at the knee will touch the seat and forces you to slouch forward for clearance or inflate the lumbar support feature to move you forward and clear the behind the knee issues You see for a 57 adult like me and my wife is 5 foot even the rear seats are too deep and makes small adult legs float and not reach the carpet which makes your legs numb after awhile But the car is solid handler so it washes out
1,This is my second Chrysler I have a child in a wheelchair and this vehicle was the best as far as space available inside for chair and passengers The first was bottom line and cheaper than other brand minivans It gave me nothing but problems The second time around I decided to get top of line Chrysler Town and Country Touring maxed out Bad choice It wasnt any better Air conditioner poblems from leaking inside to blowing all kinds of ways the shocks are horrible they actually squeek with every little bump I went to have them replaced but are on back order The ride is so rough Gas mileage is horrible Short in outlets and many others This will be my last Chrysler and Dodge
0,I looked at every similar vehicle  Porsche 911 and Cayman SLClass  but just couldnt find the right fit I am so pleased with my decision The car has enough sportyness to feel like a performance car but without the harshness or diminutive stature of so many other sports cars Im 63 and 250 lbs To say that it is in a class of its own is too trite but there really isnt anything comparable Thus far its been a whole lot of fun Ill let you know what longterm ownership is like
1,I will never buy any Chrysler This vehicle is been at the dealer multiple times for many problems brakes battery AC noises vibrations transmission axlesand more The service experience is been horrible last time they had to replace the transmission torque converter for shifting problems and the service adviser said that the problem with a defective shaft was caused by not rotating the tires what They think people dont know how to search for information these days
0,For months I had been testdriving different cars looking for the one Porsche 911 BMW 335i and 135i Mini Audi and even the Volvo C70 In my opinion nothing else comes close in terms of the whole package This is a sexy car that flies turns and brakes on command I just came out of a 530i and at 600 250 lbs I am more comfortable in the 650i Smooth and quiet powerful yet reserved  until summoned
1,I bought the 07 base T  andC in a pinch I didnt do my research I wish I did I got the base model and the only thing I got was the DVD system BUT headphones werent available for this trim nor was the van wired for them Bogus Not only that but there are no air conditioning vents in the back We had to get a clip fan from an autoparts store so my son wouldnt be so hot Nobody warned me also that half of the vans value is lost in the first year I paid 17k  some neg equity and a year later I cant get more than 9k for it 9 Thats terrible I am very unhappy and because of this I am never buying a Chrysler or minivan again
0,Ive owned a lot of great cars ie Porsches BMW M3s etc but this car is the complete package The styling is gorgeous great performance superb handling and decent mileage for a V8 And if thats not enough its a convertible with 1 button control I love this car
1,I really wish I wouldve taken my time in buying this vehicle It handles horribly it feels like the steering wheel goes side to side when driving It veers the right the dealership told me it was the tire pressure not its not fuel efficient The seat belts on 2nd row seating make it hard for people to get to the 3rd row seating Probably because its a bench seat but that was bad engineering on Chryslers part The side view mirrors are manual Hello this is the millennium So is the clock you have to put a pen in the clock to change the time Again I was rushed wish I wouldve taken my time I wouldnt buy it again Oh yeah the 2nd row seats sit so close the front row No space for my kids
0,This car is a great touring vehicle Very refined comfortable and easy to gain speed In a sense this car is too good for American roads as it truly comes to its life and purpose at 130150 mph which is absolutely illegal in states It effectively replaces a small airplane in Europe and loses much of its value stateside
1,This is the 3rd and the worst Town   and Country I have owned It rattles and chatters 40 mph in the front end Dealer says its the road Loud and noisy front end Dealer says thats normal I had a old 50s pick up truck that clunked and rattled less Not fun to drive cause you are never sure if or when something in the front end is going to fall off or break Excessive wind and road noise Cant wait to trade it off for a modern vehicle
0,I have now owned my 2007 650i convertible for 8 months Being a longstanding BMW enthusiast I traded in my 2004 M3 convertible a car that I truly loved With the 650i you get M3 necksnapping acceleration with a more luxurious ride and interior The iDrive although a pain at first is actually pretty neat Go for the options nav Sirius comfort access bigger tires Whats a few extra bucks at this point This car will make everyone take a second look especially when youre effortlessly passing them at 110 mph This Beauty is a Beast
1,This T  andC does not measure up to my 1997 LX Quality of interior materials wind noise and a terrible stereo need to be addressed Poor gas mileage
0,This car is a hot rod with the comforts of the 750i I look forward to waking every morning and driving this car great fun
1,I drive a lot so I see good and bad about a vehicle My 2nd minivan but 1st Chrysler No above bars to assist getting inout of vehicle layout of radio and heat controls poor window controls not good because very close to manual door lock Seat is okay but behind neck is very uncomfortable Tires have tread but terrible traction Feel like vehicles not setting tight on the road Radio poor reception Vehicle often feels like it may stall and difficulty accelerating Blind view areas Layout of window defrost blows air in your eyes Uneven dashboard near defrost vents and speakers causes bad reflections in sun I strongly feel it will cause me to hit something on the right side
0,The second day I drove this car down a two lane road with the top down listining to the purr of the engine I was filled with satisfaction that Id made the right choice WOW What a beast
1,My 07 base Town and Country is a gas hog Mileage is awful in town I have never made a trip in it I am sure I will get about 15 mpg on highway
0,Unmistakable German engineering Handling excellent for a car this size but not as easy to corner aggressively as with a 911 and its oversteer which makes any turn at any speed effortless This is more a touring car and less a sports car Very comfortable and manageable interior The iDrive is very easy to learn and use Sport package comfort access and headsup I do not have HUD a must You cant see the speedometer or tach when cornering which is a distraction when pressing the car around turns Overall a very impressive and formidable automobile Not quite the Ultimate Driving Machine but an excellent standin A 911 is a 911 period
1,The 2007 is our third T  andC  traded in our 1997 with 150000 miles on it  still running We also have a 2003 T  andC that has been problemfree Looked at others but theres no way they have the comfort reliablity and features the T  andC has The leather stow n go seats are quite a bit more comfortable than those in a 2005 touring version I have ridden in  not bad at all We will be looking forward to not removing seats every time we want to haul something or take our dogs for an extended drive The quality of the leather on T  andCs seats is also a cut above other vans and its a quieter minivan than others Its a good value for us
0,Drove it on the Autobahn after European delivery in Munich all the way to Vienna  awesome power handling and comfort Navigation and heads up display took me right to my Vienna hotel Car is great fun to drive and a real head turner  would strongly recommend 34 hours with the iDrive manual in order to fully appreciate it particularly if used in conjunction with the steering wheel controls Trunk handles two golf bags and rear seat is definitely functional Heads up display and sports package a must as is upgraded stereo system Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this vehicle and also the European Delivery program  BMW does it right
1,I just purchased a 2007 I drove all brands of vans crossover SUVs There isnt a vehicle out there that rides drives and delivers value like the T  andC Limited I had a 2000 Limited They just keep building a great machine with a lot of comforts Power doors and back lift gate are wonderful Stow   and Go is great
0,Went for a drive in the country last weekend and all I can say is WOW Car was rock solid at 110 and when passing a car it was still pushing me back in the seat at 80 Has all the torque you would ever need Soft leather seats and a well laid out interior The exhaust rumble make you want to drive it This car is a keeper
1,This is my Fifth Town   and Country and Caravan in 10 years Both me and my wife have one Every time my lease is up I look at all the vehicles from Honda Toyota and Hyundai They cant hold a candle to the looks and value of these Chrysler vehicles I cant wait for the new 2008 model
0,This is my 2nd BMW 650i I had purchased 222007 I traded my 2006 650i coupe for a 2007 650i convertible Since the sun roof did not slide back on the coupe I got the convertible instead I am very happy and pleased with the convertible This car has the perfect package comfort luxury handling performance agility and beauty inside   and out The color of mine is Alpine white with the new upgraded leather beige Mine came fully equipped with all options except HD radio which you cannot have if you have the realtime traffic for the navigation This is an awesome feature to have iDrive is not difficult to use as long as you are willing to learn People stop complaining
1,I bought this van new for my family needs I have 27000 miles on it now and have had no problems so far The only complaint I have is the transmission downshifting from 2nd gear to 1st gear It has a very hard downshift that is very noticable If feels like Im doing damage by driving it with this condition I started noticing it around 800 miles and thought maybe it was just breaking itself in I took it to the dealer and they said that they could find nothing wrong with it I personally think that they dont want to acknowledge the problem Other than the transmission I really like the van
0,Although Ive only had my 650i for a week or so I am already impressed with the quality and feel of such a high performance luxury coupe It has plenty of power and very stable handling My last car was an 05 Porsche Carrera This BMW is much more luxurous and as much fun to drive without all of the bumps of a much stiffer suspension Beautiful lines classy interior and the iDrive isnt at all that hard to use once I spent some time with it Im very pleased with my choice
1,Very upset In 1 year must have been in service about 5 times Air conditioning changed twice Problem still continues Radiator cap changed twice Sill leaking lost bracket that holds rack pinion boot trans shift very hard at time
0,Its really a good car and all of a driving experience I work homeoffice so do not use the car a lot  only 7500 miles per year average however it is quite enjoyable to drive it every time I go the airport and go to pick up the kids at school
1,This is the noisiest car I have ever driven Sounds like the transmission is already in trouble after only 4000 miles and earlier The road noise is awful  Could be the tires Will take it back to the dealer next week but compared to my 2000 Voyager its just noisier and parts internally and externally seem flimsier Hope they are not going back to their old poor workmanship compared to Japanese cars
0,Fun to drive great handling for a SUV with the 19 and sport package a little rough riding at times though Comfortable and decent fuel economy premium fuel uhh No issues to date Nice sound system nav is just ok but the bluetooth rocks An overlooked small SUV that competes very well all around careful price jumps with options Good Value if you buy 1 year old
1,Driving and comfort not an issue the caravan performs Its the transmission thats driving me crazy When slowing down the tranny is trying to downshift 2nd to 1st is a real pain The clunking or grabbing is a real nuisance Whats worse is Wellington motors is denying that Chrysler had issues with this tranny and still is selling these vans Chrysler Canada aside from trying to give me  dollar50 gift certskeeps telling me their engineers are looking into it I have been told that the fix would be there early Aug2007 that was moved out to the end of Sept to the new year and now I havent heard from anyone
0,I purchased this with the sports package and absolutely love it The x3 has superb performance and handling
1,I bought a 2007 Dodge Caravan on 07 0207 Transmisson was bad the day that I drove it off the lot Have had it worked on twice by the dealership Still have the same problem as day one Chrysler can not fix the problem and like anything else you buy if it dont work it should be replaced I get get mad each time I pull from my drive Never fails that I get a hard shift I did not buy the van to have this problem I would like to know if Chrysler has plans to make repairs in the near future Vehicle has learned my driving habits by now
0,The BMW X3 is a perfect car for a person who likes performance styling and great handling Mine has the sports package and M styling and looks terrific I had driven BMW 5 Series cars for 20 years but needed occasional storage capacity to carry a drum set I also have an X5 which is beautiful but it doesnt come anywhere near the X3 for performance and handling The fit and finish is top notch with great features like the full length sunroof I also enjoy the sitting position which is higher than a sedan but not so high that you sway with every bump like you do in most trucks and SUVs One great car
1,Minivans are the way to go for all my gear and traveling with or without family The stow away feature is a must but lowers the van too much for bad dirt roads What you get for the money is far beyond what a car or SUV can deliver If they would only come up with better gas mileage I think that a continuously variable transmission would help a lot Also a computer assisted economy mode and maybe a smaller engine
0,This car has gone above and beyond what I expected Was also looking at the Lexus and Mercedes and their drive compared to the BMW was night and day If youre looking for a fun car that is the best performing car in its class the BMW X3 is the only logical choice
1,Fun so far Did not have a thing go wrong Can not wait for the new van come out with a sunroof this time and more power
0,I bought a 2008 CRV and simply was not happy with it It is wonderfully versatile but it had no power was noisy had a rough ride at times and the seats were very uncomfortable After 3 months I traded the Honda for a CPO X3 and I couldnt be happier With the X3 I really have to watch my speed The engine is silky smooth its quiet and feels solid as a rock It may not be as roomy as the CRV but I can definitely trade that for the joy of driving If you are considering a small SUV think if you are buying it for yourself or for others If you care about passenger comfort and versatility then the CRV is a great choice But if you want to have a smile on your face get an X3
1,I have owned musclecars of all types over the last 30 years from 455CID 442s to 440 powered MOPARS and this car beats them all Yeah yeah its a 4 door but so what it crushes any of the old cars in ride handling and especially performance Stock 14 mile times in the high 12s and 060 in the mid to high 4 second range prove what a beast this car is The Plum Crazy color takes me back to 197071 when the Dodge Scat Pack prowled the streets The modern 61L Hemi is underrated at 425hp its closer to 450hp That is net horsepower not gross like in the old days Get one while you still can because these cars will be gone forever by 2012
0,Just purchased my 2007 X3 with 24100 miles on it a little over a week ago This is the best handling SUV I have driven Lots of power from the 30L straight 6 Very comfortable seats Stereo sound quality is excellent Much better than my 04 330ci convertible I tried the sport package on another X3 and the ride was too rough for my taste The aesthetic updates for 07 look great Bluetooth is not always clear but works okay Also the throttle tipin is a little touchy and takes some getting used to at low speed I was looking for a small SUV that was fun to drive this fits the bill nicely The Japanese companies cant compete with German build quality ride and handling
1,My coworker described it better than I ever could have when I parked my new black charger in our lot Its so pretty its hard to look at but it looks like it might eat all the cars nuff said
0,Second BMW first being M3 Purchased preowned Love almost everything about it Has just about every possible option and package Love the 19 wheels Did have to adjust driving some to accommodate for brake assist and trans system Once I have done that it is fine and very enjoyable to drive Do not have problems others have mentioned Just took a judicious right foot Very comfy sport seats and great thick Msport steering wheel Now that we have a baby it is perfect Not my M3 but a good compromise for the time being
1,Fun car to drive but is expensive to maintain after 40000 miles Fans go out and transmission has problems Things that you should not have problems with at this mileage are failing I had a 95 Chevy Impala SS that did not cost as much to maintain and I kept it until 125000 miles If looking to buy just remember it is a DODGE
0,I have been a BMW and Saab owner for the past 20 years I have to say that after driving the X3 for the past year and a bit I am still very happy that I have it I enjoy driving and I travel a lot I go where it snows and where its hot year round I have found that this SAV performs well in most situations and is fun to drive I have had very few problems and they were all minor ones The auto transmission that I have operates differently in sport mode providing the burst of torque when you need it but I did not have issues with the transmission as noted by other reviewers I have also noted that as more miles were driven the fuel economy has gone up close to the stated 26 MPG HWY
1,1 year ago when I first bought my 2007 Charger SE used with 18k miles on it I was driving 100 miles a day Now its been 50k miles I have loved driving it for every minute My one complaint I think Ive started to hear a tiny squeak in the passenger compartment Its the barebones model with the 27 L engine so I get fantastic gas mileage The only repairs have been the front wheels and suspension after a blowout
0,Bought this vehicle used as I could not afford new Unfortunately previous owner never serviced vehicle Had to take into local BMW dealer 4x before we got the throttle response issue cleared Car hesitated and bucked was scared to be in traffic when I needed quick acceleration But the warranty is awesome treated like a queen at dealership given loaner each time who still does that No other automaker I know of Computer need to be defragged and rebooted so we could start fresh It worked my little baby is performing fantastic and I love driving it it truly is a driving experience like the ads say
1,Ive read the other reviews and cant believe that no one has mentioned that its hard to see the traffic light because of the low window Overhead lights hard to see have to duck down You have to look at the traffic light to the left in Chicago The RT drives like it just wants to keep going and never stop It really takes off on the highway City driving in Chicago is about 1617 mpg Havent taken the care on a trip but am sure the multiple displacement cylinders would do wonders for mileage
0,Although this is typically a car for women Im a 30 year old man and I love this car I needed to purchase an SUV and love how the X3 drives like a sedan but is great in the snow and on wet surfaces I enjoy the tight steering and quickness Its much more agile than any SUV Ive ever driven
1,I bought a used rental SXT 35 and It is trouble I find myself doing 80 mph in 65 mph zones If complete attention is not paid to the car who knows how fast itll go Looking forward to the day I accidentally go over a 100 Steering is very sensitive needs some getting used to This is America we need bigger cup holders
0,I drive a lot Over 120 miles a day Its sleek powerful using the steptronics and comfortable I have been a BMW owner for a few years now and traded in my 06 330i for the x3 So far no complaints
1,I love the way the charger looks on the outside other than thatThe stereo system isnt good sounds like if you turn it up at all youre going to blow a speaker When i open the door to get out it always swings back shut on me My kids always complain about the seat belt sticking The plastic interior trim looks cheap I got the 35L and Im not very impressed with the acceleration Gas mileage is OK between 20 and 23 mpg No cup holder in the back and the cup holders it has up front are small Should have bought a Hybrid
0,Bought this car for my wife who was reluctant to own since she doesnt like the tight sports car like ride She prefers the soft floating on air feel Well its mine now The X3 has a lot of get up and go and you just have to breathe on the brakes to stop the vehicle On the highway you need selfcontrol to keep it under 100 mph Its like riding on a rail However around town in stop and go traffic it is not smooth acceleration and shifting It lurches off the line and then quickly starts upshifting Its what my wife did not like about it and I have to agree All things considered it is an awesome vehicle and has a real class aura about it I highly recommend it
1,have owned 1969 charger 383ci and a 1973 charger 400ci 1964 plymouth sport fury 383ci a 2006 charger 57 every one of these were great im 63 yrs and just bought the 61SRT i put a  dollar50000 deposit at the police station just in case
0,Bought this as an American Spec X3 in Germany with the Manual 6speed and most options a superb driving machine For an AWD and SUV like vehicle it does very well on gas mileage  getting 25 hwy and 20 city and that is at 90 mph on German Autobahns The vehicle handles very well and the steering is outstanding I think the 6speed manual is key to driving pleasure and better mileage contrary to specs  but could not imagine using in city traffic and most state side driving stop and go conditions
1,I have the SXT I cant wipe the smile from my face when Im driving Im getting used to people turning to watch the car go by I have a hard time passing in traffic because of people riding beside my car to look it over Gas mileage is averaging about 23mpg for a mix of cityhighway driving and goes to about 27 on all highway It exceeds what I got in my PT Cruiser
0,I bought my x3 in 1206 My first Bimmer The third time I drove it it quit on me It was in the shop 9 days to reprogram a computer problem The hesitation problem others list is a perfect description of my x3 Sometimes the hesitation has absolutely scared me I have had a sidelight casing replaced due to moisture have an obvious rattle from the sunroof cover and have had the lifters clacking since I bought the car Today I am headed to the dealer to attempt to negotiate my way out of this car into another The only reason Im going back to BMW is because of the known problems and my chances of recouping some of the losses on it Do not recommend this car to anyone
1,Traded up from a Mustang GT because I wanted the performance but needed the room This 4000 pound vehicle handles better and goes faster than the Mustang I bought it for performance not mileage so the gas pump doesnt scare me This is the new generation muscle car that you will see in car shows for years to come
0,Original impression of X3 30si on test drive was quite positive I purchased a certified X3 30si with 12K miles Car handles well and has powerful engine Transmission is erratic at best Sometimes does not engage at all others shifts very hard and can cause nausea in passengers BMW service cant find issue which suggests that they have not figured out optimal transmission match to the 30si engine in the X3
1,I was wanting a charger in 2005 I finally got one this year I love it Its big and mean looking A little slow on take off but once it gets rolling Im gone I feel like Im king of the road when Im driving
0,Picked it up in Munich on the European delivery plan Fantastic to drive in the Austrian and Slovenian Alps Now driving it for normal US city driving and it continues to be a pleasure A very few very minor issues oddly placed cupholder on passenger side for example But have experienced none of the transmission problems others complain of and the overall quality is high This replaced an Acura TL I liked the TL a lot but like the X3 better
1,Wanted one for a while now and finally bought it about a month ago Already put 2500 miles in it So far the back seat cushion needed to be replaced because a seam came undone the drivers power window will need to be repaired because it is extremely noisy when being rolled up and makes noise when driving and the headliner makes a terrible rattle when driving over bumps or rough pavement It is because of these small teething problems that I have mixed thoughts on my purchase I love driving the car and especially love the styling but this is becoming extreme I read in a forum that the headliner noise is common on cars equiped with a sunroof so keep this in mind when choosing your car
0,I bought this when it was between the Acura RDX and Lexus RX The Bimmer won out with every feature available and I am loving it Its reliability has been spot on and it has a better warranty than Toyota Honda and GM If bought be sure to get a tire warranty I got a nail in mine and got it repaired for  dollar400 It shows how good the BMWs quality is Best buy for sure
1,Coming from a 2004 V8 Nissan Titan I have to say that Im impressed with the 35 V6 engine and I can only imagine how the Hemi would feel The gas saving is big again coming from a full size truck but is OK comparing to a regular sporty sedan Lots of room inside and very comfortable The design could have been better it looks long but its still nice looking Maybe a 2 door like it should be The rims on the lower packages need redesigning I dont know why they still offer steel wheels with hubcaps The wheels dont get better until you reach the RT package just not fear
0,This is without question the best automobile Ive ever owned It is powerful responsive agile for its sizeweight and BMWs N52 straight6 engine is buttery smooth and quiet Although one doesnt hear it inside the vehicle from outside the vehicle the X3s exhaust note has a nice bit of a growl I opted for the 6speed manual transmission and I must say it takes a bit of getting used to The clutch pedal has a lot of travel in it but the engagement point is a fairly narrow area quite near to where the clutch pedal is in its undepressed state Im impressed with the fit and finish of the vehicle and it just has a nice solid feel to it
1,The car has great pickup 060 very fast Comfort good I like the autostick feature The fuel mileage is OK approx 1821 average The braking is excellent noise factor minimum It has a great look the front is slightly throwback in style Ive gotten a lot of nice car comments from everyboby The only issue I dont like is the noisy auto steering only when pulling out or in or parking Overall good value styling and performance
0,I have owned this SAV for almost a week now This is my first small SUV I am a car guy but I travel where there is snow a few times every year and I wanted to be able to take something on my trips that would drive like a car but be able to take the weather with no worries I think I found my vehicle The handling on the X3 is great and I dont find the suspension too stiff I did not order the sport package My X3 was ordered with the luxury package the 18 wheels front seat warmers servotronic steering upgraded radio and xenon headlights So far I am very satisfied with this X3 I look forward to every drive every day My advice is to go and test drive one
1,I ordered my Durango from the dealer I got the Adventurer with the 57 and the tow package and 373 rear I get 175 on the highway I love the power drop the hammer and itll smoke any truck The split third row is great and heated leather seats are a must My only complaint is the rack and pinoin steering with the AWD when it hits a bump the wheel tends to jerk to the right The windshield is also too far forward making the passenger side Apillar a major blind spot when driving around a sharp left turn I also ordered the 4WD transfer case Havent had much snow in south Jersey yet but it handles great in mud and the snow weve had
0,Reporting back after 4500 miles driven This X3 has a faulty transmission It causes hesistation on acceleration from a stop in curves on hills and in turns The transmission needs to be reprogrammed reference SB 240807 Even after reprogramming the transmission is erratic Would be very careful before purchasing
1,Let me begin with the interior it was suppose to have stain resistant fabric interior it doesnt The fabric has marks where my child got in with a damp swimsuit on can get it off the door handles do not match each other the seat belt harnesses have fallen apart the plastic on thee drivers side seat is breaking The truck is a fuel hog and the gas cap doesnt make a good seal which makes the service engine light come on when you refuel or get low on fuel both of which happen often There is always a lag in the transmission when driving   and driving up a steep driveway is nearly impossible Worst vehicle I have ever owned Would not recommend to anyone
0,I had this car for a 1 12yrs and I love it This is my first BMW and I will continue to buy due to the best warranty service Ive taking my car in for an oil change for zero cost The car handles very well in the rainy season the seats are comfortable The sunroof is awesome though a little loud and the trunk is very spacious Ive driving this car from and to California and it just runs smoothly The performance of a BMW is no comparison
1,We just had our first child   and needed something with more room than my mustang Even though there were many choices out there and we test drove them all the durango slt had the power v8 room 3rd row seating cargo space when the 3rd row is down looks husky  in a good way  and comfort we were looking for Long trips I used to take with my wife b4 the baby came in the convertible mustang seemed really long Now that we have the durango I hate to say it  I like taking long drives 375 miles Dont get me wrong Im keeping the mustang  but if its a family trip I want the durango From Las Vegas to San Francisco to lake havasu we found a great car Family chauffeur by choice
0,I used to be very much against SUVs I had a purchase and sales agreement all drawn up for a BMW 3 wagon and then at the last minute I asked the sales person to let me drive a 2007 BMW X3 in a 6 speed manual WOW I was 100 percent sold Coming out of a Volvo V70 T5 wagon I needed the practicality of a wagon to haul items for my business The 3 wagon did this job but was a bit tight The X3 had more room without sacrificing anything in performance So far the experience with the vehicle and BMW have been nothing less than superb Sure it is not a cheap drive but the fit finish is unbelievable I am getting 2324 around town and 27 mpg on the highway I HIGHLY recommend the 6 speed
1,I have had this truck for a few months now and have little complaints The common complaint here is fuel consumption It is a truck with a V8 what did you expect Some people just need the power and room and that will cost you in fuel costs If you are looking for 30 MPG get a VW Space is great and there are a load of great features The all time 4WD drive is great for my wife All the safety and I dont have to worry about her screwing up the transfer case by shifting wrong My suggestion is to buy it used The depreciation for a new Durango is ridiculous like  dollar10000 the first year You can get a  dollar40000 truck for half the price if you go one year old
0,My husband and I love our new X3 We were originally going to go with the Volvo XC90 but after test driving the X3 we loved it It handles better than the XC90 and its cheaper
1,Dont ever buy one I have 14500 miles on it and the four wheel drive binds up when turning Not sharp at any time Transmission slips a lot Sways on freeway leather seats hard
0,I downgraded from a mom mobile minivan and I love this little car It fits me and my two little ones nicely Its quick and fun to drive The gas mileage is better than my van and the tank is smaller so fill ups are less too even using premium gas I love the bluetooth capability I feel so much cooler in this than my van
1,Did a lot of research before purchase Durango was more bang for the buck than Tahoe Armada Toyota Hemi is great good mileage for a large SUV plus plenty of power Towed trailer to Wyoming no problem Beware FlexFuel is a crock In the owners manual it states up to 30 percent reduction in MPG with FlexFuel Also do not mix Flexfuel with gas unless all most empty FlexFuel is media hype Nice ride a little tight on rear seat leg room Dash latout nice and easy to read 6 Disc CDRadio takes some getting use to not eacy to understand without manual
0,I purchased an 07 X3 for my wife six months ago and we couldnt be happier City parallel parking made short body length important factor Ultimately we chose between the Acura RDX and the X3 This 07 X3 had a far superior engine compared to the 05 and 06 versions that we test drove In fact the older engines disappointed quite a bit This vehicle handles like a 330 The AWD was flawless over the New England winter Mileage is good for an SUV The ride is just a touch stiff but much softer than my M3 on city roads and overall its a joy to drive Storage is far better than a sedan Reliability has been perfect
1,We love our van because its easy to use with kids Thats where it ends Its been in the shop twice for a leaking transmission  the rubber the window on the drivers side falls of if you shut the door too hard The remote start doesnt work the transmission clunks when downshifting the tires are terrible there isnt enough power and the wing mirrors are fading We have a total of 14000 miles now  Not impressed
0,I was hesitant while buying this car after testing both Acura SUVs Lexus RX Mercedes ML Missan Murano Infiniti FX Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 and it performed the best The only thing I disliked about the car is the limited availability I live in Maryand and the closest I could find was in Virginia 400 miles away from my dealer I got the sport package and love it The seats are more supportive than anything One thing I would recommend on the car is getting a warranty on your tires I got a nail in my tire after 1200 miles It was a  dollar450 tire Luckily I got it insured One thing that BMW never has gotten right on any car they have made is cupholders
1,We have had problems since 500 miles There is a terrible problem with the trans and engine We bought because of the price and 7 seats No way can you fit 3 car seats in the back row We are done with the lemon law now Thank goodness It was in the shop every month for at least 2 days Most times 5 to 7 days while they put new parts on They pushed us around and kept telling us nothing was wrong but there was Broke down completely 3 times and had to be towed Please dont put your family in danger with this car My friend bought an 08 and just finished her lemon law as well Too bad this couldnt have been better was nice to be able to take all the kids in one car
0,We purchased the X3 early this year So far I have no regrets Reasonable gas mileage Confortable heated seats and fun to drive
1,We bought our 2007 Grand Caravan SXT used without 23000 miles on it We had been shopping for a minivan for a few months We wanted a HondaToyota but for the price of a 4 year old HondaToyota we were able to few months old Grand Caravan We are very happy with the van Tons of cargo space the kids fit in perfectly and the wife likes driving it The build quality is lacking but you cant not expect all that much from an American car company anyway Some interior parts feel very cheap The transmission thunks and jumps at low speeds Gas mileage is 16 city very hilly and 27 highway Not too bad for a truck
0,X3 is a very beautiful car in my opinion which has a very good stable design and controls that make it very safe and help on running fearless while driving this car 200 KMhr is not a dangerous speed at all in this car due to its high safety controls Also it has a good cd player with a fantastic sound system
1,Please dont buy this minivan I bought mine used a few weeks ago and already the transmission is gone It has poor gas mil It shakes and rattles at a slow speed I must admit the price is what lured me in
0,The interior is well appointed and everything is within easy reach Im a little disappointed on the sound system I was told by my BMW rep that iPod connectivity was standard It does have a port but you pay extra for the integrated cable for control on the sound system the speakers really arent all that my jeep grand cherokee was better in that aspect I have only had it 4 days but I just love it otherwise I look for excuses to go for a drive the gas mileage seems to be ok except when you get on the gas hard tranny seems rough
1,Love my van mpg could be better love stow and go hard to use unless you have the seats all the way forward vibrating at around 30 to 35 bothers me never can seem to get it fixed will keep after them I didnt like how the muffler side pipe shows so I put on custom running boards to hide them looks great I am impressed with the power accels great Should have a built in antenna Not good in a car wash had to replace my antenna already only had it two months
0,BMWs European delivery program is one of the best Our car was waiting in Munich with a tank full of gas and ready for our trip across Germany Switzerland and France Our X3 performed flawlessly over international roadways and narrow back streets We enjoyed traveling 1500 miles before leaving the vehicle in Nice FR for shipment to the USA
1,The comfort of the vehicle leaves alot to be desired The automatic doors sometimes dont work as they should With a 38 L engine the drive could handle a little bit better The fuel eff is good and I like the Stown Go seating
0,I just bought the X3 after months of research Ive been very happy with it Great engine nice interior good interior storage space for vehicle size
1,I bought this van for space for family Though Im happy with the space I was highly disappointed with several features or lack of features Stutters and jumps when traveling slow speeds like in a parking lot The climate control is horrible No way to switch between heat and airyou just have to adjust the temp up and down one degree at a time in three different places No way to turn on just the fan cool temp means air conditioning I paid over  dollar500 for remote start but wasnt told the stinkin thing shuts off in 10 minuteswhats the point of that Console did not close or lock9 weeks later still not fixed Mileage only 15 16 mpg whether in town or on highway Dont like anything else except the space Will never buy a Dodge van again
0,I drug my husband to test drive the Lexus Hybrid SUV he drug me to test drive the X3 On paper I really thought we would like the Lexus better but the X3 won hands down Easier to turn into a parking space felt roomier in the front so much fun to drive Im only 54 but felt I could see out of the X3 better and with more personal space Now my husband and I are at odds over who gets to drive the SUV its MINE Who would have thought
1,The battery went dead at 3900 miles and again at 5922 miles My first few tanks of gas I only got a little over 10 MPG Now I only get a little over 13 MPG Very disappointed with this vehicle I will never buy another Daimler Chrysler product
0,Just completed my first commute in my new 07 X3  it turned the twisty mountain roads into a flat straight freeway The V6 is very quick   and smooth handling is fantastic and updown shifts by the 6 speed auto trans were imperceptible The brakes are almost too good as I am learning to be very gentle with the brake pedal to avoid stopping too fast Looked at CX7 RDX RAV4 CRV   and Edge  the X3 was far and away the most fun to drive while getting better mpg than CX7 RDX   and Edge and only 2 highway mpg less than Rav4   and CRV AWD Storage room with back seats up or down was equal or larger than these other CUV options
1,Sounds like the other reviewer got a lemon I dont think Chrysler would be the  1 Minivan if it was like the one he seemed to have gotten I love these things and you cant beat the value
0,Just took delivery on an X3 The mileage has been a pleasant surprise The vehicle is well built and feels very solid The transmission is not up to par with the rest of the vehicle It doesnt shift smoothly and hesitates
1,Fun car to drive I installed a Jet chip to even out the sluggish starts I cant complain though it is only a V6 35L and not a Hemi The chip worked nicely Next is a K  andN Air intake cheap ways to gain a few more ponies
0,I always said I would NEVER drive an SUV Im not Im driving an X3 and its probably the most fun and convenient car Ive ever owned Normally those two words cant be used in the same sentence when describing a car Im disappointed in the gas mileage but other BMW owners seem to be fine with it The interior is divine Cup holder doesnt hold odd size containers but everything else is perfect
1,Nice comfortable car with lousy windows and mediocre controls What were they thinking Hard to see stoplights tops of hills etc through narrow low windshield the back has a narrow slit that gets dirty fast and is hard to see much in the rear either Only question was where to mount the machine gun in the bunker The cruise control trip odometer are poorly located and designed who needs an extra left handed stalk that runs right across the gas gauge Did you hit the turn signal or the cruise control Bad design Controls and instruments have been much better designed in nearly all cars for over 50 years Styling just to be different just dosent cut it
0,This is my second X3 Traded in a 2005 This is one of the best handling carsSAVs out there You just can not do better then the Xdrive system Get the 18 wheels and Premium Pkge The Xenon headlamps are great I get 19 to 20 mpg driving to work but if you drive around 70 mph you wont get 26 mpg
1,Two weeks after purchasing this SUV it went back to the dealer for various discrepancies Problems started with brakes roof rack and electrical Recently had rear brake jobs and returned the following day with ABS warning system and noisy when brake pedal is activated
0,I purchased the X3 in Germany and have had the pleasure of driving 100 mph on the autobahn for the last 3 months sooo fun Handles like a dream both in snow and on dry pavement Steering is quick and responsive The inside is roomy and quite comfortable The size is perfect large enough to pack everything I need and more yet small enough that parking even in Germany is no problem I didnt get the navigation system because I already had a Tomtom I ordered a side dash mount from ProClip so the GPS doesnt take up space on the windscreen and the placement is excellent Top quality vehicle
1,I bought my Nitro new and within 1 week it was back in the shop to have the entire AC replaced Here are my list of repairs for a 2 yr old car AC replaced door lock motors replaced 3 times starter replaced pass side airbag repaired said off when pass in seat center console replaced outlet in back fell out of socket car charger socket fell back into dash 4x4 repaired sunroof repaired radio blaring when car is off my personal fav etc
0,I owned 3 Ford Explorers back to back I test drove 2 BMWs an Acura and Lexus I found myself going back to BMW for a second test drive I could not believe the handling and drive I find myself amazed after 2 months each time I get into the car I find myself uncomfortable when I drive any other car now as in maneuverability
1,Ive had my Nitro for two yeaers no major problems besides brakes scratching alittle The acceleration is somewhat poor but picks up when needed The car look great and I get alot of compliments and turn heads However overall dont feel like its solid transportation
0,Ive just changed my 2005 X3 for a new one The 2007 feels more comfortable cleaner in style and a bit more powerful Same old leatherette in the seats but a sturdy more easy to manage leather steering wheel Lets put it this way a nicer a gentler car
1,This car is nothing but fun No problems with it at all Recalls obviously but other then that no other repairs Gas milage is surprisingly well Great hauling vehicle Lots of jump off dead starts take any little 4 cylinder car anyday
0,I bought this for my wife who is very difficult to please and was coming out of a 5 series wagon This vehicle does everything well and even she is impressed Most vehicles that are this much fun to drive are not at all practical but this vehicle does it all Everything about it is top quality If you drive it you will want to buy it Dont bother with the sports package The standard seats are more comfortable and the standard front facia is much better looking
1,I have had nothing but problems  rattling  power windows not working taillights go out now I have a noise when I tap my brakes the noise continues even if i am not applying brake my jeep had this same problem  interior is plastic  I have noticed transmission when shifting is problematic 
0,Very beautiful car on the outside Gets pricey as you add on the options Competitors offer more features
1,Do not buy the Nitro at this time I bought a 2007 and have had transmission problems that started about a month after I got it Ive taken it in for flash computer upgrades but it still has a bucking problem I did some research and found that this is not an isolated case It seems that corporate really doesnt know what to do They keep sending you back to reprogram the computer to make you feel better for a while but it doesnt fix the problem I have owned a Chevy and a Ford before this and have never had these problems I would say to anyone looking at the Nitro get something else or wait until they get this transmission problem taken care of
0,I have owned my X3 now for several months The performance is truly unbelievableI traded in my 2000 ML320 only because the upkeep was becoming more than I was willing to pay I am so glad I did this is a much nicer vehicle at a better price Almost ten thousand dollars less
1,Dodge has done it again After being a new model buyer of a 2004 GMC Envoy XUV I had no hesitation to try another protocol vehicle This was a gift for my wife and I had to find a ride comparable to the Envoy but in a smaller package for gas milage improvement Our Sunburst Orange Nitro has fullfilled and exceeded our wildest dreams Not only is it a blast to drive but having all the options available  we are extremely impressed Not a single flaw in performance nor in the assembly of this vehicle We highly recommend this to anyone looking for downsizing their guzzling suv and not sacrifice the drive and ride The color scheme accented with chrome creates a lot of looks as well
0,This one has it all styling handling utility safety and everything you would expect from BMW I thought it was too overpriced until I drove it It is but it is such a wonderful vehicle I thought I would give it a try and was amazed at the lease payments because the residual value is so high I dont think you could find a better small SUV or SAV as BMW dubs it I love the size its agile and offers utility Its definitely a sport ute
1,I saw the Nitro on the lot last November just after it came out I knew that was the next one for me Now four months later not a day goes by that someone doesnt ask what it is followed by I really like it I still dont see many on the highway but people dont know what theyre missing It rides solid and handles well Mileage is better than my last foreign SUV
0,Just bought this X3 last Saturday It was a great experience driving it since this is the first BMW we own The exterior and performance are perfect The interior could be improved We may know it more after we drive it more Not so sure now about reliability and fuel economy
1,I am very unhappy with my Nitro It misses out Tranny is very sloppy and they say this is normal Bad gas mileage and under powered I would not reccomend to anyone
0,I just purchased this vehicle less than a week ago and I love it It drives great and no comparison from my last vehicle 2003 xterra The power is excellent and so far gas is good This vehicle I can handle having for a very very long time
1,No one can say that the Nitro isnt sharp as can be in the looks department It is quite the head turner but as another wrote thats where the good ends I have had several new cars over the years yet none in the model releases first year The 2007 Nitro is a prime example of why homework is important They have many issues with this vehicle that they cant or wont address It rides very roughly the transmission feels like its constantly searching for whatever gear its in the headliner squeaks against the underside of the roof it has electrical issues that cause operations to fail and it is cramped feeling inside I traded a PT Cruiser for it so go figure Please fix mine
0,Its hard to find fault with this one Its stylish has unique bells and whistles and performs while providing utility and comfort BMW truly is the ultimate driving experience It far surpasses the Mercedes sports sedan I traded for it The only other vehicle Ive owned that compares to it is the BMW 5 series I once had
1,Overall Im not very happy with my Nitro My biggest complaint is the road noise With my work I have driven most every new vehicle on the market and the Nitro has far and above the most road noise Not a lot more plastic than other SUVs but definitly feels and looks cheaper It gives it almost a hard feel Mechanicly no complaints enough power etc Fuel economy isnt great but then thats not why I drive an SUV
0,I just got this vehicle a week ago and I have to say it is amazing I got it fully loaded with everything except the sport package The interior and exterior quality is the best
1,I bought the Nitro for the great styling high standard feature content and room inside After 3 days the satellite radio quit took 4 weeks to replace the antenna worked 5 days and quit again Throttle response is horrible push the gas and wait 1 second then it revs makes it very hard to modulate with manual transmission which is unacceptable for a computer controlled engine It reminds me of my old slant 6 Volare Engine pulls willingly but doesnt seem like 210 horsepower gas mileage not quite up to rated but close Engine rough and a bit noisy not up to todays standard of refinement Center console too wide nowhere to put your feet but under the pedals
0,This is my first BMW and SUV  I love it Definitely a nice upgrade from a luxury sedan previously had 2 Audis The ride is firm and sporty and the interior is plush Lots of power and sports car handling You owe yourself to take a serious look
1,Dodge can dress a vehicle up and give it some curb appeal but it ends there Nitro underperforms for me Quirky and cute looks on the outside are a plus Interior is horrible Stiff and uncomfortable seats tight width spacing odd foot room on both front driver and passenger Overall ride fair very stiff and bumpy Handles very well in snow but odd jerkyness when in 4wd and moving thru parking lots low speeds 015 Heating system lacks power badly and direction Lack of freeway power to pass lags before speed engages Overall not the vehicle I expected Not recommended
0,Having owned two X5s Im thrilled with the agility and the power response of the X3  firm ride yes but smooth and tight A joy to drive  sporty and more enjoyable than our Z3 and our 325csi
1,Love it stepped down from a Land Rover Discovery II and do not regret it Do not pass this great lil SUV by
0,I have a really loaded 2007 X3 Its an unbelievable machine I buy new cars very frequently and have gotten kind of bored with them The X3 has given me that teenage excitement of having a car again I really enjoy driving it Its acceleration handling and braking are just awesome All of the latest safety features are in it The fit and finish are top notch The leather interior is beautiful The transmission can be used in regular automatic drive sport drive and manual Hands free communication and BMW assist are very convenient The BMW is in a class by itself
1,My Nitro 07 is the beast vehicle around for the price It handles great it is solid with tight steering and power The look is tough and cool I am about to lease my 2nd Nitro I have a different vehicle as well more expensive than the Nitro and the quality is not a good as the Nitro Just because it is a lower cost SUV your not losing anything compared to the higher cost SUV Get one now
0,The title of my review says it all about the 2007 X3 The exterior styling is just amazing I cant tell you how many people have come up to me after seeing the X3 and said to me hot car or some variation of that And its an SUV Performance is excellent you really need to hold this baby back on the roads The new 260 hp engine is just perfect Handling is incredible too The interior is upgraded and beautiful You really feel molded to the seats they are so comfortable The X3 just exudes class in every way You just feel so great sitting in it and driving it is just plain fun
1,I have had this vehicle a week short of 2 months and have 3000 miles on it So far I have had several problems with this car The first problem was that I was driving down the street and the car just quit Dash startup system lights came on and it just quit I took it to the dealer and they couldnt find any codes in the car showing it happened Then a couple of weeks later the electric lock swith plate on the drivers door quit working I am waiting for them to get one from somewhere Now just yesterday the car quit running going down the road again Locks popped up and it just quit This is very annoying after paying almost 26000 for this thing
0,Fun to drive Higher view position than sedan and same comfort as sedan Very smooth
1,I bought this vehicle for my wife however I have a hard time passing it on to my vehicle I think if this was around when I bought my vehicle I would have bought it instead My wife loves it also I know we will be traveling in her vehicle more now By the way we exchanged a Lincoln Navigator for it and it rides better than the Navigator It gives my Mercedes a run for the money
0,X3 2007 is nearly perfect with its new engine and transmission and improved interior It is the best vehicle I have ever owned and I have been driving new mercedes since 1993
1,This SUV will become a verb Took the 4WD for a test drive and then ended up buying the 2WD just because it was what I could afford  So far I like it A bit light on the back so it fish tailed on a turn when I was merging on to a main road It also made the tires squeal After the scare I had a silly grin on my face Talk about midlife crisis I am mean again
0,The performance and driving experience has exceeded my expectations in the first week of ownership I like the sporty feeling and the acceleration response and the luxurious feeling I am happy with the 25 milesgallon on my first tank of gas It is a huge step up from my 04 325i that I still own I am looking forward to a little snow at this point Thanks from a happy bmw owner
1,My new Nitro had 19 miles on it the day that I purchased it on September 26 2006 The vehicle is really a blast to drive it has great pickup and the handling and braking make the midsized SUV feel like a much smaller vehicle I have had numerous people gawking at my Nitro everywhere that I take it I even had one guy stick his head in the window while sitting in a parking lot  while I was still in the truck As of this writing I now have 7 days and 345 miles of pavement under me So far the only complaint that I have is the gas mileage not being anywhere near what the sticker indicates averaging about 1525 MPG Sticker indicates 1723 I was hoping that it wouldve been at least 19
0,I have only owned this car for 3 days but I already love love love it I previously had a volvo cross country wagon but wanted to sit up higher and have more pep This car really delivers It is so well made and handles beautifully The drive is smooth the seats are comfortable with great lumbar support and the visibility is outstanding Really a fun car to drive
1,When I bought this car I was actually looking for a Jeep Liberty I saw this car and liked its looks It was brand new and one of the first RT models available in the city I decided to give it a try It has had three recalls already Had to take it back to the dealership at least four times Its not fun to drive the speedshift is awfull Not enough space for your feet The plastic used inside looks a little cheap Constant problems with the central computer The RT model sure looks nice bus performs and handles terribly Take a look at the latest consumer report for new cars 2009 It doesnt have one good thing to say about this car Cant wait for my lease to be over
0,This X3 rules in the mid size SUV market I had a 2004 X3 with the 30 this 30 is upgraded to 260 horses and it runs I have the manual and it says the 060 time is 68 with a K  andN drop in I say my time is below 65 This baby can run
1,Ive had my Nitro RT 40 engine for 11 mos now and Ive had a number of problems with itTwo weeks after I got it I noticed a like chattering noise from the engine First they said serpentine belt The noise got louder My crankshaft bearing and pistons have been replaced My Sirius radio has had 2 recalls Needs new one Heater doesnt work right Now my roof rack has a recall on itT hey are tired of working on it Take it to another dealership Sad thing it only has 9700 miles on it What nextWhat will it be like in another year Parking it is terrible too Wider than my other SUV Hard to see where you are in a parking space Too much money too many headaches Stay away Not unless you want trouble
0,I had seen the reviews etc on the 06 X3 and since then the interior has been vastly improved Super quiet Driving is a dream Quick acceleration great gas mileage in these times of higher prices I actually have more interior room than my 04 Durango Great braking and 5 front airbags for safety This car is a head turner Take a ride in one When you return you will buy it
1,Since the night I bought this car 123107 it has been a mistake The night I drove it off the lot the radio died because it blew the fuse It does that every 3 months or so Every other time the radio dies and has to be replaced completely The roof rails have rattled and been loose since day one They have been replaced 2x under warranty and still rattle The brackets holding the seats were all rusted and had to be replaced The door hinges are rusting The side panel in cargo area was warped and was replaced Part of dash was bubbling and was replaced Now the transmission is making noises and hesitating My driver seat back wont adjust at all Been a problem since day one I hate this car
0,Exceptional upscale SUV Handles like a fine car but has all the advantages of an SUV Just purchased this SUV in late October but it has been a dream to drive Interior has many improvements over previous years Higher quality materials used Also larger engine but with better mileage
1,I have a 2007 nitro rt nitro I put this info once before I have an answer now Im having a problem with chattering in front end Its the serpentine belt Chrysler cant fix this problem I had it in the shop twice The service told me that Chrysler dont touch it A service rep came out He called the eng They sent out some parts to put on it but the problem isnt fixed Its better but sometimes its still just as loud I took it over to the dealership I was getting all of my receipts to send to my atty The ser Mgr Heard it doing it again Took it in for service and hes gone I called my atty They said I have a case for the lemon law I was told niitro rt wasnt designed for that size eng
0,I need to preface this by stating that my previous car was a 2002 745i so I can handle anything gremlins can throw at me So those individuals complaining about a few service issues are just whiners to me So lets get to the heart of this This car is a beast It growls and snarls with the ferocity of a caged dragon It throws you back into your seat and gives you butterflies in your stomach yet acts with the utmost refinement when traffics forbids its potency The way its sport mode flies through its rpm bandwidth is breathtaking It does everything extraordinarily   and nothing mediocre Its technology is prolific so glitches are par for the course Drive one it is truly beauty and the beast
1,I have had my Nitro for a little over a year now   and absolutely hate this vehicle Here are the problems I have had so far park brake does not hold vehicle on slight incline unless you give it that extra little pull to the last notch park brake boot zipper splitting 5 times dealer glued it closed   and say that was chryslers fix it split open the next morning truck completely shut off while I was driving roof rails lifted up pass seat squeaks ac isnt very cold cant roll up pass window from driver side unlock switch actually locked all doors seal on rear pass window replaced tire press dings in cold temps seat belt warning when no one in pass seat key fob issue when vehicle running
0,The X5 with the V8 has nice acceleration and a throaty growl The ride is noticeably harsher than our MB GL450 and neither really exhibits excessive body roll On worn highways I often try to drive to the side to get a smoother ride I really regret getting the side aluminum running boards they make it much more difficult to get in and out While many reviews say the iDrive is easy to learn I sure wish BMW would add more dedicated buttons The GL450 is much easier to use to access the map radio etc
1,Fell in love with this vehicle because it looks different  not the same old thing Seats are comfortable for me steering and brakes are responsive Lots of luggage room Then it stalled while I was driving 75 mph on the interstate  twice Several recalls later and that problem has been corrected Rear seal leaked interior plastic is warped in a few places sunroof leaked I like having a reliable vehicle and Im not certain that is what I have with my Nitro I drive close to 2000 per month and I like knowing that I can get in keep my gas tank full and my oil changed and go wherever I want to without worrying about reliability Not sure that is what I have with my Nitro shame
0,Traded in a porsche CS for the X5 The X5 is perky but not as fast as the CS The X5 is nicer to drive on long trips and has features like bluetooth   and ipod Tire wear should be better and cheaper The iDrive is a breeze to use as is the voice command function very cool Great suv but do your own homework
1,After 1 12 years and 35000 I have never had such a lovehate feeling for a vehicle Good style and good ride MPG ok for the size1923 Computer system water pump roof rails wiper motor and switch have been replaced under warranty Have had 2 recalls so far Roof rails are cracked and rattling againvery poor designand this will be my last visit under warranty Not sure I want to own this Dodge when its out of warranty coverage
0,Our X5 is a real winner with its good looks surprising good gas mileage with average of 21 on our very first trip great handling and well thought out design If I cant drive our 530Xi I want to be behind the wheel of this vehicle Comfort and heated seats are a must The iDrive is easy get over it
1,Just like a marriage after 7 years it was love at first sight she was beautiful had a great body gave your a rush when you came close to her but she became fat and heavy and wasted all your dough and didnt do it for you anymore Poor handling sways side to side when going over small bumps poorer gas mileage interior has too much plastic I E doors dash center console Large blind spots invest in blind spot mirrors Everything got a strange little delay to it from honking the horn to accelerationbraking Brake light burn out often After two months the window switches stopped working No power on flat out acceleration dont try to jump in on the highway if you dont have room
0,We have had our X5 for over a week now and we love it After reading reviews I was a bit nervous with iDrive However it takes about an hour to master We really love everything about our X5 and would recommend this vechicle to anyone interested The only problem is we do not want to stop driving it It is truly fun to drive
1,I purchased a 2007RT in Feb A manager was driving it It has 6700 on it now It Making a chattering noise from the front end At times it seems to get louder Two dealerships called Chrysler and they know about the problem But they dont what it is and they dont know how to fix it They say it is safe to drive How do they know if they dont know whats wrong or fixing it
0,For those new owners of a BMW X5 30si there are several units with a problem with the AC blower motor If you have heard a grinding noise coming from the inside of the AC vents you have it The part is in back order If you havent heard the noise contact your dealer and ask if your car has the problem Pray that your dealer is honest and will tell you the truth Very very frustrated with the brand A  dollar60K should be flawless
1,Bought it as a demo with 930 miles on it Was in the shop for the first week of ownership Replaced cracked roof rails steering sensor and the ABS sensor Took a week to figure out which sensor was keeping the ABS steering stabilizer and traction control lights on Quality control is awful Should never had traded in my PT Cruiser
0,I love this car the ride is smooth performance is outstanding I have one word for this car The Ultimate Driving Machine
1,Since purchase Ive had no major problems but a few concerns The 12 shift is harsh when cold a slight whistle sound from the AC system and the glaring lack of a rear AC vent for a vehicle of this size annoys me Gas mileage hovers at 21MPG but only when driven like a baby carriage Everything else is fine and Im impressed considering the price I paid
0,Drives and handles superbly in comparison to the Mercedes ML350 and Lexus GX470 More features like run flat tires xenon headlamps etc are standard equipment but on the others they are options nicer looking and zero cost maintenance warranty the kind of warranty you used to be able to get with a Mercedes
1,Bought a 2007 RT from Bill Kay in Naperville avoid them As for the Nitro RT its a real head turner w red paint and 20 wheels it gets a lot of attention The mileage isnt too bad I ave 16 mpg on regular gas which isnt bad for an SUV that can tow up to 5000 lbs The ride is firm Ridgeline Envoy and even FJ cruiser rode nicer but it IS related to Jeep so expect a truck ride Performance out of 40 liter is almost as fast as my stock Prelude SH which is admirable for a brick on wheels Interior is a little on the cheap looking side but it is clean and uncluttered Wanted a Trailblazer SS but this gets as many looks lower priced better on gas and cheaper insurance
0,Other than fuel economy that comes from a 350 hp V8 in a 5000 pound SAV the X5 48 is a blast to drive The iDrive was not hard for me to pick up I really like the sleek gearshift with its two shift programs plus manual The SAV is tight as a drum and no issues to report
1,These are dangerous it stalls when sitting in park surges while you have your foot on the brake like someone is pushing on the gas radio replaced eating cds computer telling tires need air when they dont These suvs have issues going to abritration and a attoney They look great but stay away Many recalls
0,Very nice SUV  weve had other BMWs but this is the first with iDrive and I agree iDrive stinks In spite of the iDrive this is the only SUV I have ever driven that is actually fun to drive Weve had a few Denalis and Tahoes It drives like a BMW Overall its a good car fun to drive Id buy another
1,We bought the Nitro in August Has been in the shop a few times for pulling right Its had two alignments and still pulls Today it shut off on me I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone elso
0,The navigation unit pales in comparison to that of HondaAcura The X5 is nimble unmatched in its ability to handle quick turns The acceleration is very good considering the low gear takeoff I found the steptronic transmission feature allows for smooth quick acceleration in M3 to M6 The transmission seems to work a little harder in M6 than in D6 I have 5100 miles on mine in 3 months I really enjoy driving this SAV The third row seat is only for kids under 5ft and under 120 ibs
1,Nice vehicle Great price Major complaints are the bumpiness of the ride  very trucklike Also UConnect feature and satellite radio are not included but buttons are on the factory radio
0,I too had issues with the transmission not wanting to shift Luckily I was near my home Nonetheless I took it in and a computer reset was done  havent had the issue since Otherwise traded an 07 Escalade for this beauty I love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for sporty driving as well as utility
1,slt with leather wife loves it i hate it many problemstrans howls in 1st fuel economy same as v8 2000explorer poor seats collapsed cold air drivers left side roof rails replaced parkbrake boot 5 radio replaced eating cds head lites terriblei replaced the bulbs now ok i am proceding with the arbitration avalible hear in canada hope the will take this dog to the pound
0,This is my second BMW and my new X5 supports my previous statements about BMW being the best ownership Ive ever had This X5 does everything right The computer controlled transmission operates exactly the same as if I was making the decisions myself The X5 drives amazingly like the Porsche 911 I recently owned probably because of the Sports Package and 20 wheels that I insisted on having This SAV is as close to perfect as any of my previous vehicles
1,Overall great ride Im a little disapointed with gas mileage though I recommend the RT model The 40 is a blast
0,Picked up the X5 this month and put 800 miles on it the first weekend Car handles great and is not even comparable to the Acura MDX I have had two MDXs and this is a big step up Test drove the new MDX and decided to go with the X5 even though it was more money Car is rock solid
1,Bought this vehicle about 10 months ago and have had it in the shop around 7 times already First was the recall for the motor shutting off while you were driving Had to have the roof rack replaced as there was a bolt missing On the drivers side dash there was a gap that had to be fixed and now it wont defrost properly I have troubles with the locks that wont lock when its too cold There is a horrible whining noise when it starts if it is lower than 15 outside The engine rides rough My new problem is that the key got stuck in the ignition and wont come out I like the look of this vehicle but the whole performance issue is another thing
0,Amazing handling very responsive particularly for its size feels smaller and lighter than it is Interior design very thoughtful and attractive Bullet proof on ice and snow Xdrive sport package plus all the numerous electronic aids simply work Overengineered takes much study and trial and error to use myiad systems The iDrive is just plain tedious  flying the F16 was easier Bottom line if you like to drive this is an easy choice over its peers
1,Its appearance is what drew me to it HoweverI dont think they put a lot of thought into the interior design no creativity no toys reallydoesnt reflect the exterior image at all I opted for the 6 CDDVD player expecting a screen to accompany itIt didntNot that I dont like listening to movie Its just not the same without the visual No response yet from them on whether or not there is any video output If notwhy offer it Exterior The tires look wrong I opted for the 17they should be biggerwider They are cookie cutters The luggage rack shakes at around 95 km or in wind For me the only saving grace lies in the aftermarket
0,My 3rd   and last BMW two 7 series and this X5 With 1300 miles on my 48 X5 it had to be towed to shop while I was 800 miles from home when the electronic transmission would not shift Computer updates were no help As I write this from my motel room after 2 days of waiting the factory folks are still scratching their heads Other than the reliability issue the car is very rough riding Wind noise is too pronounced for a luxury car selling at this price point The ventilated seats are superior in overall comfort to the hard buckets which are standard The runflat tires cost abt  dollar500 each to replace and should be an option not standard
1,A car ownership nightmare Ive had the car in the dealership 4 times in 8 months It misses hesitates cant decide what gear it wants to be inwhatever you want to call it They even replaced the transmission Now Chrysler says it cant be fixed   and has declared the vehicle a lemon Its still going to cost a lot of money cause they dont just take it back   and give you a new one You only get tradein value   and I wasnt ready to put out the bucks for a new car Buyers beware
0,The X5 has been a pleasure to own and drive BMW has made owning this car a pleasure to have with a wrap around warranty program that covers everything including brakes and always being available to cover your needs The car in all the time I have had it has only needed oil changes and a brake change Thumbs up BMW
1,Well first of all the sunroof leaks The right side back glass leaks The luggage rack is coming apart It shakes real bad when idling at a stop Sunroof was fixed but still leaking Does not pull for crap Im gonna get rid of it as soon as possible
0,After indepth comparisons to Mercedes ML 320 CDI ML500 Lexus GX 470 and Cadillac Escalade the BMW X5 won me over quickly in a variety of areas from build and finish to actual ride drive and handling Most of the others offered spongyswaying rides not the X5 The V8 is a beast and the 6 cylinder is more than adequate and the mileage is much better Certain option packages are well worth the cost like the Premium package the Technology package Sport package and definitely the Active Steering as well as the Comfort Assist The Active Steering provides an incredible increased handling effect And 4 yrs50k mile bumper to bumper INCLUDING maintenance is sweet as well
1,Dont be fooled by the cool looks of the Nitro Ive had problems from day 1 First of all the radio stopped working so the dealership replaced it then they replaced it again Then the check engine light came on I had it in 4 times before they finally fixed that The transmission slips they say this is due to needed download that Chrysler hasnt developed yet I also have a water leak that two dealerships cant find Now I drive around with 2 inches of water in the passenger floor pan the interior stinks and the carpeting is ruined Now Im in arbetration to have Chrysler buy this lemon back I have never been so dissapointed with a new vehicle purchase ever DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP
0,BMW has done an outstanding job with this redesign The old and new X5 both perform well but the new X5 adds REFINEMENT to the equation Windroad noise are hugely reduced Interior quality is greatly improved The sport package with active suspension hugs the road yet gives very smooth ride quality with minimal lean in corners Contour seats are excellent although the active massage seats are a little weird like having a python slowly undulate under the seat cushion No squeaks rattles No defects I tire of the computerchallenged press who constantly complain because they cant learn all iDrive features in a 10minute test drive I love the control it gives over vehicle functions
1,I bought my Nitro a month ago and I love it I was a little nervous when I read some of the reviews but I have not had any problems that were reported When I got home I noticed that I could not put my passenger side when down or up on that side but the drivers side I could close and open it so I just took it to the dealer for replacement and have had no problems since Even if I do wind up with transmission problems I have unlimited powertrain so I am not worried at all I only got the base model but with automatic and I love it it is not limited at all
0,Bought new 2007 X5 sight unseen Ordered in October picked up car in January In gently rolling area the X5 30 seems underpowered The transmission is constantly shifting and feels like it is straining If you really put your foot on the gas its not as noticeable Love the design in fact am trading in for the X5 48 Its going to cost but my mistake
1,I went from a 2004 Chevy Monte Carlo SS to this and was I disappointed The test drive was fine The problems didnt seem to show up till the drive home The vehicle surges from 040 mph and struggles to find the right gear It sounds like it is in the wrong gear when accelerating Hwy speeds are okay If you need to merge dont do it This vehicle has no pick up for passing 2 days after I bought it I was back at the service center getting my recall fixed I didnt know it was legal for a dealership to sell a car with a potentially deadly recall on it I cant wait for that survey to show up I must say it does gets some heads turning All eyes are on me when I pull up but I miss my Chevy
0,They did a great job revamping the car Lots of power and stabililty Upscale interior especially with the upgraded leather option
1,I got the RT model after looking at nearly every SUV under 40k and even a few over I was looking for something that didnt look emasculated   and not too big either I was also looking for something that didnt look boring or genericI had it narrowed down to the new LR2 or the Mercury MarinerFord Escape when I saw the Nitro RT version I went and drove it   and was convinced it is suprisingly smooth and quiet at 80mph it feels like its quietly cruising its got peppy pick up and just a smooth quiet ride all around The RT model is clearly the most unique small SUV out there I got a late 2007 model so no problems that early models seemed to have Its a great buy overallesp for the money
0,We waited 5 months for our 48 X5 since we had to order it and it has exceeded our expectations It drives like the 5 series with excellent handling and power The engine is quiet and the road noise is minimal We originally had an MDX and it is steps up in performance handling and comfort I highly recommend the sports package
1,I bought my Nitro in 1207 and its a head turner and I was exited but not for too long It is up to the second recall The first was for the brakes and the second for engine stalling I do not feel safe after these recalls The engine makes a noise that the service dept does not know what to do I have to attempt to buckle my seatbelt several times before it locks the stain guard on the seats do not work because Ive tried to remove stains that do not come off All the service lights have come on twice so I need to get that checked I also think that it has poor quality paint because a pigeon pooped on the hood and I didnt wash the car right away and It ruined the paint in that area
0,I bought the X5 in early January 07 was very close to getting the audi Q7 and have owned 3 other audis But I wanted to try somthing different and glad I did So far so good This car is smooth confident and looks beautiful I test drove all the midsize type SUV such as the Acura MDX Mercedez ML350 Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne I bought the X5 demo model so it already had 1000 miles on it Was a little worried about that but no issues so far and all is covered under warranty
1,I just bought my black Nitro RT a few days ago So far I love it Im hoping I dont run into any of the mechanical problems others have mentioned but so far it cant be any better Im surprised no one has talked about the MyGig system yet Its awesome The navigation and satellite radio are great I already have pictures of my wife and our dogs on the hard drive and displaying on the screen My only complaint so far is the hard drive space I knew some of the 20 gigs would be used but there are only 8 gigs available Its a little disappointing to have less than half the space advertised Hard drives are cheap why not stick 120 gigs or more in there
0,I absolutely love my new X5 My husband and I argue over who is going to get to drive it on a daily basis We previously owned a 2005 X5 and loved that vehicle as well however this new model puts that one to shame Definitely the best SUV around
1,Love the way it looks but it stops there Since I bought this SUV it has been in the shop 13 times and Im taking it back again ABS lights have been on forever they cant seem to fix it All sensors have been replaced and modules and bearings and rear axle a new electrical harness radio and I caould go on and on This is a nightmare The lemon law is gonna work for me on this one Dont buy it Theres no pick up and go and no room for feet in floor board Also bad blind spot Noisy and engine tics and runs rough Also 2 new brains Im sure Im forgetting something
0,This is one of the best handling SUVs or SAV according to BMW Ive driven equalled only by the new MDX But what differentiates the X5 from the MDX are the tangible and intangible qualities of a BMW handling quiet cabin solid build growl of the engine great styling and the looks you get on the street We loaded the car up with lots of toys  lets hope its as reliable as their airtight 4yr maintenance program The only areas of improvement are the unnecessarily complex iDrive and limited legroom in the 3rd row
1,Before I bought this truck I read every one of these reviews Now after owning it for a few months Im surprised they were so positive I thought Id add my 2 cents Put simply if you buy a truck to use a truck Avoid this one I tow and use my truck alot off road Build quality is extremely flimsy Tranny has very irritating and weird shifting tendencies Road wander is horrible in this thing The slightest little bump will send it bouncing all over the road If you just go to and from work and Home Depot on the weekends and dont mind the bouncing into the next lane when you hit a bump This truck is for you
0,Absolutely a great X5 Had it for 3 weeks and love it Wonderful driving experience Acceleration and control put together beautifuly I was waiting for this X5 after having a 30 before and I just love it
1,Overall I have enjoyed this vehicle But I am having a ton of problems with the tailgate It is really hard to close at times or it wont even stay shut
0,This is my third X5 to own The interior has been completely redone and is very nice The new body shape is also very nice It rides great and handles like all BMWs The added 35 horsepower to the 30 is noticable
1,I own the 07 Ram 1500 SLT Quad Cab with the 47 V8 automatic About every 23 months theres always something crapping out in it Off the lot it had a module bad that wouldnt allow the keys to program Starting issues that are still not resolved because it wont duplicate when the techs are looking at it Both fog lights broke They fixed that About 3 months later check engine light Some canister failed Took 2 weeks to fix that 9 Month mark trucks starts to pull They replaced a bushing Took 2wks for that still pulling They aligned my truck to a faulty machinethey admitted their machine was bad and got that fixed Radiator fan will grind under heavy stress and engine temps
0,The X5 is a great SUV This is my second X5 It is a great car dependable and comfortable safe and has many features
1,First truck my cousin had to remind me in Texas a ram is not a pick up its a truck I have has thirty comps about the look I have had all types just looking No problems at all this is my first new vehicle that I havent had to take back in for something I want the duel exhaust better radio little more quality in the cab and more paint choices like cool vanilla I would buy 09 with that color Looking at 09 when they come out Great truck
0,This is my 5th X5 and its a huge improvement over a vehicle that was already very good Its quieter smoother more comfortable handles better has greatly improved interior convenience The upgraded contour seats are outstanding Sport package technology package premium sound system are worth the money Im one of the few who likes iDrive and this is the best one yet I wish I had known that you cant see the headsup display if you wear polarized sunglasses Ventilated massaging seats are probably not worth the cost 3rd row seats add weight to the vehicle and will rarely be used unless you plan to haul elfsized people or kids Headsup windshield display is not worth the money if you live in a sunny climate and wear polarized sunglasses 350 hp is adequate but it would be a much more exciting vehicle with an additional 30  40 hp
1,Poor performance and 4x4 weak 19000 miles and transfer case went south very poorly designed transfer case 48000 sticker price paid 38000 new and less than 6 months later dealers only want to give 19000 trade in fuel mileage on hemi is pathetic 109 to 11 mpg this is the worst car buying experience I have ever had and that most money I have ever lost on a vehicle through depreciation come on Chrysler We are at record high fuel prices inflation killing everyones wallet and this is what you do for your customers Thats crapI Dodge thinks they have owner loyalty because people keep their dodges a long time but that is because when you buy a Dodge you owe way to much to sell
0,Just bought my X5 today after a long research This is a real drivers SAVSUV braking is excellent this X5 really holds the road 30 has plenty of power Third row seat small but how often do you need to haul 7 adults over 56 BMW made large improvements over the 2006
1,Bought the truck as it looked great in dark red with chrome 20 wheelsboards and the Hemi No disappointments averaging 17 mpg have driven 20k miles and have not had any warranty repairs or rattles No complaints
0,The bottom line is that the car is great Not a thing to complain about The perfect everyday driver The iDrive is easy and very intuitive I would suggest using the memory keys and the voice commands while driving
1,Great truck Getting on average 18mpg Has lots of room lots of power and yes its got a Hemi Has cheap stereo system and seats
0,Other SUVs cant come close to the safety and drive of the X5 The X5 drives like a dream handles like a car and simply put hugs the road If you needed to swerve to miss something you feel very much in control in this vehicle I would recommend this car to all The 3rd row is just generic but the adjustable 2nd row makes up for it
1,This is my fourth Ram PU First one was in 1999 Last one was in 2004 and was stolen took a while to replace itbut was worth it Hard to compete with Chryslers discounts My seconed Black one this time with Added Chrome Bling Love the ride and HP on Demand Great for Towing my new Searay Will be Adding new chrome wheels soon to replace Factory 20 Fake chrome Buy a black one and make it shine
0,Great car love the styling straightsix sounds great and the manual gearbox is supersmooth Love the seating position as well as the interior space with the easyfolding top up Very nice to drive the car is very communicative and gives you lots of confidence brakes are amazing and stop the car with little drama My only complaint is with the interior buildquality The onepiece door panels are great but the steering column is tilted a cup holder is broken I dont even use them and the transmission tunnel plastic trim squeaks when you rest your arm on it Besides that everything you touch is of highquality and just driving it takes your mind off its few squabbles
1,My Dodge has all the motor performance you could want Ive had both Ford and Chevy and it beats them hands down The one area seriously lacking in the Ram is the fit and finish Ive had trouble with door seals rattles and a poorly opening center console
0,Ive had my Z4 coupe 15 months and have 17700 miles on it First car I have loved Im 65 and behind the wheel I feel like 25 I have driven just about all sport cars but none have turned me on like my coupe I drove a Porsche on a race track once but this coupe will beat that Porsche on any curve anytime And I might add for half the price The Z4 coupe is and will be the only car for me When Im too old to drive Ill sit in my rocker rock the day away while looking at my Z
1,Hard miles with the minimum maintenence has stuck me on the Dodge truck I purchased a used Dakota with 150k miles and sold it two years later with 214k before buying my Ram 1500 I was hoping that the Dakota wasnt a fluke because you know sometimes it just depends who was working the factory that Monday when you get those trucks that just keep on going But my 1500 has not dissapointed yet Ive put a hard 52k in one year and it runs like it just finally got broke in
0,I bought this car as a retirement present present to myself curiously I see a lot of guys mostly my age driving these cars I have thoroughly enjoyed driving for short hops I have taken 3 trips of 500 miles and this is not the car for it The RFTs amplify the bumps on bad roads and we all know what I95 can be like Other than that it is so much fun to drive and cornering is a terrific experience I have the 6speed manual and wouldnt consider the automatic  that would just be wrong in a sports car
1,The 67L diesel has major problems The engine clogs I have had the truck contantly into the shop Dodge does not have parts available and does not seem to have a fix designed The engine parts need to be replaced or cleaned constantly The fuel economy and power drop with each trip to the dealer I seriously recommend NOT buying a Dodge with this engine I paln to try to get different truck via the lemon laws in our state The truck has been in the shop for the same problem over and over and is going in again soon
0,Nothing like completely changing a day as to hop into the Z and spring off into the night Incredible driving experience and am lucky to have many windy roads to enjoy Fun fun fun
1,We have not had very good luck with our 2007 67 cummins We have had a lot of trouble from the particle filter With my experience with diesels if it doesnt smoke something is wrong Cannot make this truck smoke Every 12000 miles we have to have the particle filters cleaned They say it is impossible to put a aftermarket chip in it What you buy is what you get Hope things level out on repairs
0,I purchased my Z4 for pleasure driving only sunshine time This was to replace my previous convertible of 5 years that I sold last year After test driving numerous cars once I sat in the Z4 I knew this was one for me It amazes me every time I take it out for a drive Usually there is a limit that a car can handle in driving performance but I still cant find it with this Z4 Its like I can take that I dare you to go farther Needless to say this is a car that can get you in trouble BMW really knows how to design and build an exceptional convertible They have mastered what it takes to create an unparalleled driving experience I am impressed
1,I HATE this truck It has been in the shop more than in my driveway Everything that could go wrong has I had a Chevy before and my husband wanted a Dodge because the 67L Cummings diesel is supposed to be the best I cant wait to get ride of this disaster and buy another Chevy This truck is a Lemon
0,Purchased mine certified used with 11000 miles on it Very fun to drive Looks fast is fast I rarely used to put the windows down in my old cars but with this car I put the windows and top down every chance I get I get many compliments on itit is simply a sharp looking car and turns plenty of heads I love how Z4s are not as widely popular as say a 3series and that was a big reason why I purchased mine If youre looking to buy seriously consider the metallic silver color with premium package With the sharp angles of the body styling silver looks beautiful
1,I am a small business owner and I use the truck to haul a fuel transfer tank and tool box I am pleased with the power of the Cummins There is no noticeable loss in whether empty or loaded My problem is the build quality This truck is just over one year old an it has been in the shop more than my Chevy that has over 130000 miles They have replaced the rear diff seal the rear window the main computer and now my check engine light is on All this on a vehicle with less than 32000 miles It becomes a hassle trying to run a small business when you cannot use your truck I should have listened to my wife and bought a CHEVY
0,Wow I compared this vehicle headto head with Porsche Boxter   and new Audi TT The classic design along with BMW safety and technology won me over hands down
1,I bought the truck to tow a 6000 lb travel trailer with room to upgrade to something heavier Our first outing netted 13 mpg at the California mandated 55 mph towing speed limit It achieves about 22 mpg sans trailer The drivers door shudders on bumpy roads and is poorly sealed The transmission shifts down quite hard when coming to a stop Cruise controls are very awkward Very rough riding Love the Cummins 67 liter It has yet to shift down out of 6th gear on cruise control We now have 1500 miles on it and look forward to thousands more
0,This is by far the best vehicle Ive ever driven Simply a blast to drive even with the ESP on Youd be hard pressed to find a car that handles better It inspires confidence going into every corner and with skin off your face brakes and an unbelievably seamless ESP even when the most OMG situations come up you have the brakes and the control to avoid idiot drivers The suspension is a little bit on the eggbeater side but its well within the range of comfortable without sacrificing real performance Basically this car does everything you tell it to making everything feel really easy
1,It is a shame that we cant pick in the menu above the one with the Cummins This is the best truck I have ever had It is also a shame for Toyota on trying to copy the Dodge style the broad grill and the large headlamp Overall nobody builds better trucks than DaimlerChrysler
0,I love the car Bought it wsport   and premium package  no nav I feel like I am driving a rocketship stereo with its the THX sound and direct aux for my listening to my iPod It still has a few minor quirks like remote door locks  sometimes the passenger side wont unlock wthe remote and have to unlock from the center button which a car this price should not have This is the first BMW I have purchased and now understand the obsession There is no better feeling than putting it into SD automatic trans and seeing all the other cars left in the dust 
1,I recently bought a 2007 2500 Dodge truck with a sticker price of  dollar47745 Its a laramie 4x4 diesel quad cab long bed I cant believe how cheap this truck is built Most of all the chrome wheels and the chrome front bumper is fake The Dodge people should be ashamed of how much they charge for these trucks This truck should cost  dollar10 to 15k less then the fFrd or Chevy trucks This truck gets126 miles per gallon There is at least 25 to 30 more options that come on the F250 lariet or the 2500hd LT3 for the same price or less This is my first new Dodge pickup I would never buy another Dodge Thanks one very dissatisfied customer
0,When the worst thing you can say is that the cupholders need to be redesigned youre on to something This car is a headturning sleek machine with incredible control and power Great fun to drive
1,I love the way the interior is set up and it is comfortable too It steers and drives great The only thing I dont like about it is the post beside the frount window is a big blind spot
0,I was initially hesitant about buying a roadster but after owning this for two months I wished I had purchase this sooner Make sure you get the stick shift because thats half the fun Also get the sports pkg with the sports mode and upgraded wheels The sports mode provides livelier accel and steering When driving the Z the car is truly one with the driver me
1,I see some people are complaining about fuel milage I can tell you that I get about 20 hwy and about 165 in city Best truck ever
0,I wanted a little excitement in my life and this car really does the trick Its so much fun to drive I hate to get out of it I leased the 30 convertible wautomatic trans and premium pkg Punch this baby and youre on a roll This car turns heads everywhere I go It looks fast it is fast and it sticks to the road like glue
1,As a 3rd vehicle The Beast doesnt get driven everyday which is good because it is very large and stiff However the towing is great Tows like a dream and tons of interior room in the mega cab Gas mileage is averaging about 23 miles less than the Duramax I had previously except when towing then its a little better 7 hour highway trip towing to the Florida Keys with a 15000 lb load I get 95 mpg if held to 60 mph Around town 1112 mpg with no load Added air bags to level the truck when loaded work great
0,Started with a 23 Z3 moved to 30 Z3 and now 30si Z4 This is the best one so far Took me a few years to warm to the styling but now suddenly it clicked The chassis is exceptionally stiff  as stiff as the Z3 coupe was Makes a huge difference The car feels of one piece and there are no rattles or creaks Huge storage space in the trunk for a 2 seater excellent gas mileage very powerful engine A pleasure to drive
1,I drove one of these truck brand new owned by Chrysler Corp pulling a show trailer all across America on the Jeep Go anywhere Do Anything Tour The trailer I pulled was 50 long had a show vehicle show engines etcand was extremely heavy I dont remember the exact weight now I went through the Appalachians Rockies took on headwinds across the deserts and plains went through death Valley where the temps were 115 F plus This truck did a great job I thought The fuel mileage considering the load I was pulling was a very acceptable 12 mpg and about 18 when I was unhooked I zipped around all the major cities with no problems Nav system was the best feature for finding ANYTHING
0,The car does what youd expect great acceleration exhaust note handling When driven with the top up on those notsoperfect days there are a few rattles in the roofseats Its not as fast as a Vette off the line but the seats are exceptionally comfortable the THX stereo sounds awesome and the nimble handling make it all worth while in the end However if you plan to do most of your driving with the top up or in the winter months dont bother
1,My first RAM was a 1990 W250 4x4 later traded for new 2002 new 2004 and now 2007 I haul a 12 foot 3500 pound slide in camper and tow 18 foot FLW bassboat The fuel economy and power was unbelievably fantastic Running empty 24 MPG I tracked my MPG using a spreadsheet on my computers I tracked my fishing holes too Fully loaded the camper was 3500 pounds sittin in the bed and the Bassboat was 6000 tow weigh At 65 MPH I did between 205 and 217 MPG The 2007 has been a big disappointment My last long haul we averaged 88 MPG and running empty 146 When you hit a head wind out west you can expect a filter light on the pollution systems All that power of the 67L and I couldnt use
0,What a fun car to drive Get heated seats no matter where you live Great feeling when top is down Get the M seats The Nav is great today ties in to radio and phone and great maps Double click remote and you can put top down before entering car Get the prem package and sport package Get Xenon lights and hard top prep Sport button is awesome great driving stability control sytem Entended leather is awsome Wanted automatic transmission thus the 30si 265 HP plenty but if you just want manual and 355 HP go for M Its a fun fun fun car 0 to 60 in 6 secs Fast rides great feels great Heads turn when they see
1,This has been a great truck The 2nd one I have owned The only concern I have is the transfer to ULSD from the diesel we now use
0,I dont know if there is another car as fun to drive as this
1,My Edge has stalled on me several times usually  stop lights and the Dealer cant find anything wrong with itDoes anybody have the same problem The tires are very noisy Hancookand I had a rear bearing replaced already
0,I leased this car back in 07 and have not had one problem My dealer ran a computer search for the CXS in the color and options I wanted For me it fits my needs perfectly love the remote start sport tuned suspensionFE3 36 dohc engine is excellent and still gets good gas mileage
1,The oil is constantly leaking have had the car in the shop multiple times they can never find it or say that it doesnt need to be filled all the way for the transmission then my panoramic sun roof explodedshattered over my head one night driving down the road nothing hit it and there were no other carstrees just shattered scared me to death Shock on right side leaking smoking fixed not fixed lost part not the right part what other excuse could Ford give This is my first and last Ford oh and the paint has bubbled on the drivers side door and the door lock on that side will never unlock with automatic unlock and they say it needs oil ha that doesnt work either
0,Swapped a 98 Regal w 163000 miles for this honey No one has mentioned the greatly improved drivers seat  this one needs no extra firming to make it tolerable on a long drive Room is adequate for us and I am impressed by Buicks overall longterm reliability This 3rd Buick in 20 years My only negative is that the rearview mirrors create some strange blind spots that have to be considered at all times
1,I bought an SEL in Creme Brulee loaded with all the options including the panorama roof and navigation system I traded in a 2004 Explorer Eddie Bauer V8 for the Edge Compared to the Explorer I like the ride lower step in height better mileage and roomy back seat On the downside the interior of the Edge is a sea of hard plastic and poorly styled interior elements compare the front interior door panel of the Edge to a Saturn Outlook and you will see what I mean The interior is way to cheap and cold feeling for a  dollar35000 car The navigation system is good but not great
0,Excellent to great car I have driven GM cars for over 30 years Only problem experienced so far is the catalytic convertor was replaced this week with 24000 plus miles Bought the car as a demo for the PGA tournaments The converter is covered under the warranty I thought GM had the converter problem resolved years ago Still enjoy the car A bit small in size
1,december 18th 2008 I purchased a 2007 ford edge i have enormous problem with the transmission
0,Had a Regal before this I like this car a lot better although the Regal got a little better gas mileage Other than this no complaints
1,I purchased this vehicle in June with high hopes Im over 6ft After living with the vehicle I am sadly disappointed in its comfort If your over I say 510 you need not apply The seat bottom cushions are far to short to offer support for longer legs The footwell for the driver is short on space also making driving very uncomfortable and your only relief is when you go to cruise control on a hwy Despite the suspect claims of good gas mileage from other reviewers the gas mileage stinks only 18 for a 6cyl is absurd An Expedition gets as good I was only getting 10 at first Im light footed on the gas so I dont hotdog Im looking for a new vehicle
0,Only thing I wish was better is fuel economy I get around 1820 in town Otherwise I love everything about this car Ive had it about 4 months now and I love driving it Mine is black and I have to say no offense to anybody Ive seen it in several colors and this car just looks better in black I added a spoiler and got the windows tinted and it looks sweet Gets lots of compliments from young and old Everybody likes this car
1,If you are looking for a family vehicle but dont want a minivan or full size SUV Edge is it Ive read all the reviews from major publications to googling Ford Edge reviews Only real knock I can find are the brakes its 600 stop is lackluster Ford please address All around engine is stellar 6speed auto performs well handling nice feel but not ultra sporty ride quality the same blend of comfort not to squishy Buick Like but not Mazda like either Test drove all others came down to CX7 and Edge Wanted the CX7 to be the winner but Edge had more room easier access to rear seats ie car seats just more practical day to day Crash test ratings cant be beat
0,In my effort to downsize I went a little too small Cabin is cramped for me   and backseat is tight Needs a modern engine   and 6speed transmisson Flat spots in the power ranges due to lack of gears It is a very nice car that is smooth   and quiet for its size   and price No problems except for recalls
1,Got 1400 miles so far took on 800 mile trip great ridevery quiet on the road A little disappointed in the fuel mileage 21 tops on road
0,When I bought this car I felt for the first time buying a car that I got a car that gives me more bang for my buck The safety features in the car are great Front and side air bags traction control The car is very confortable and does very well for gas mileage I have the CXL and Im getting about 32 mpg on the highway Very sturdy vehicle safe and well worth the money if you are looking into getting a family car
1,Headed down to my Ford garage to buy my third Explorer but really didnt want to face another 5 years of sub 20 MPG at  dollar400 per gallon Dealer suggested trying the new Edge After trial bought one I have owned it for about one month and I like it It is the only vehicle I have ever owned that people on the street turn and look at My neighbors all came over to see the car that can drive on the edge of buildings Havent tried that yet The suspension is much softer than the Explorer and other truckbased vehicles This will take a while to get used to I am hoping for average mileage North of 20 MPG Too soon to tell
0,Try it youll like it Smooth ride and solid power Use the underrated editor reviews and the grandpa image to get a bargain from the dealer I found mine after it had been sitting on a lot for 2 months  deal of a lifetime
1,After looking at the Honda CRV the Mazda CX7 the Pontac Torrent and the Mercury Mariner I decided to go drive an Edge That was all it took The Mazda had a bit more zip due to its turbocharger but really lacked for room inside and towing capacity was not there The Edge is much roomier than the Mazda not as roomy as the CRV The CRV was a really nice ride but only had 166HP and didnt have the zip I wanted even on the interstate This vehicle is by far the most fun to drive of any Ive ever owned The only thing I do not like is the headrest is at an angle which is somewhat uncomfortable on long rides and I think they are a smidge overpriced
0,I have owned many GM cars including Buicks My LaCrosse is the best yet I like everything about it I have everything on it except remote start and enjoy all features The backing light warning feature is great heated seats sat radio etc But I really must compliment GM on the OnStar feature I love having the hands free phone emergency help door unlock service and emails monthly from my car about its performance OnStar makes me feel safer when Im driving alone Thanks for a great ride and driving experience
1,The braking distance which has been much discussed has not been an issue other than that it is longer than my 05 Acura TL or my wifes previous car a 00 Focus Exterior design and interior design are spot on with a surprising amount of legroom in the second row even for passengers 63 As the car is now only 3 weeks old we have had no reliability issues The new 35L V6 is a little noisy on heavy acceleration from a stop but very quiet at speed The vehicle feels planted in the cloverleafs with minimal body lean and no tire squeal We crossshopped this vehicle with the BMW X3 Mazda CX7 Cadillac SRX Mitsubishi Outlander and Toyota Highlander
0,I absolutely love this auto Superior if not equal to the so called fancy imports The interior design is flawless inside and out All of the outside and inside panels are a complete matchas a result of excellent quality from GM I would take this car over an Accord or Camry any day
1,I couldnt wait to get my hands on the new Ford Edge I had been calling local dealers and it was hard to locate one I finally bought one and couldnt be happier The ride is great with little noise from the outside It handles great and at 55 I finally feel like a kid again
0,I researched this car for a few months and decided on the Buick rather than a small Lexus or Mercedes The new JDE Power dependability ratings make me feel really good about my selection Cannot say anything bad about the car Lively in tight situations while still exhibiting the Buick trademark smooth ride Great fit and finish Very pleased A grown up car you dont have to be a grandfather to love
1,I purchased this vehicle in Aug 08 In Dec 08 discovered a leak found out that this would be the 3rd time the seal would be replaced They replaced the PTUgot back after 8 days In Jan 09 started leaking worse than before had to drive with the window down the smell was so bad Finally got it back yesterday after 17 days Replaced PTU and axle shaft To make matter worse the gas mileage is awful When I first got it best I got was 14mpg  since it got cold try 89mpg Dealer told me there is bad gas around here Give me a break I might as well drive our 97 34 ton pickup that usually gets around 1012 I should have spent the extra money and got the GMC Acadia
0,Just driving from the dealer after the purchase and driving home I found the ride to be smooth and very quiet With the acustical laminate glass there is no wind noise Quick response when passing Underrated by the editor this is my third GM vehicle and I plan to stay with GM
1,I have also had the Power Takeoff Unit PTU replaced in my vehicle along with metal that was in my transmission oil leak Just recently i was on a steep hill and my car drifted ever so slightly backward and the transmission made a horrible sound and the whole car shut off and all my lights came on I do love the car and its great in the snow but transmission and mechanically its bad I never had an issue with other Fords Just disappointed because it is a beautiful car
0,We are absolutely thrilled with our LaCrosse It is luxurious and exilerating I look for reasons to leave the house just so I can drive the LaCrosse The 38l V6 needs no urging and jumps at the chance to run like the wind It dives into corners with an unquenchable hunger and the traction control adds a new level of control The car is almost alive in its ability to know how to get through the corners You dont drive a LaCrosse you command a LaCrosse Weve never been so thrilled by a luxury sedan
1,Vehicle is a lemon Avoid purchasing Returned 5 times for ptu unit leak Oil leak so bad caused engine fire Back from garage less than a week and leaking again Transmission needs replacement shudders and rolls backwards on hills Rear hatch panels seperated from vehicle twice before being replaced Gas miliage not even close to advertised Worst vehicle I have ever owned 6 prior
0,Car magazines under rate this car while owners rave about themLets start with the outstanding good looks of the vehicle no other car can compare to it for looks So I would advise those who test these cars to look again and rate them more fairly If you had to buy a car for your own use you would want one of these
1,I have had the Ford Edge for two months and it only has 22000 km It has been in the shop numerous times The drive shaft a wheel bearing and parts of the Vista roof have all been replaced I took it in again because there was an odd woooooo noise at exactly 90 km and 40km Was told its tire noise  Continental Cross Contacts I was driving yesterday and the vehicle just lost power in the middle of traffic The ABS  powertrain and anti slip lights all came on A faulty sensor I now wait for some part to come up from the US Numerous unexplained noises poor braking Ice builds up on the inside of the vista roof Its terrible in the snow I want my Escape back
0,My intentions were to purchase a Honda Accord for the gas milelege and resale When I first look at the Lacrosse in May without the Chrome Package   and it looked plain to me I drove the car 1500 miles on vacation last week and what a ride I want to commend Buick on the ride performance and most of all the gas milelege for a new car Wow 30MPG What a great car I never was so pleased
1,Fun to drive great in snow Only complaints seat belt hard to attach and the blind spots at both rear corners Gas mileage could be a little better 225 and 155 Overall very happy
0,Bought an 07 with little over 4000 miles We were impressed with the extras remote start dual climate control among many others We get tons of compliments on this car Only suggestion would be to add air vents in back for back seat riders Overall the best car we have owned by far The ride is very smooth the power is awesome
1,Purchased my Edge in February of 2008 One week later someone plowed into the passenger side causing  dollar9500 in damages Walked away with no injuries whatsoever I didnt really feel much at inside the vehicle at all No signifant body roll considering Extremely safe No real complaints except the dealer flashed the computer and I lost some power Engine noise is a tad loud but its am American vehicle  it happens Traded a loaded 05 Altima 35 V6 for my Edge and glad I did Gets better fuel mileage believe it or not Drove from MA to SC fully loaded w4 adults a child and a full load of luggage Gassed up at the first BP we could find and averaged 30 33 mpg at 7075 mph
0,This car has many nice features but I am very dissappointed it dosent have memory seats rain sensing wipers heatac temp control on steering wheel and no rear seat heatac ducts on a  dollar33000 vehicle I also miss the heads up display on my previous Buick This car will have a short time in my garage for these reasons only
1,I wanted an AWD4WD vehicle but was tired of driving a truck I love the vista roofthe safer alternative to a convertible I love the acceleration and the ride The exterior gives it kind of a mean appearance and demands a second look from everyone I pass In different light the Pewter color sometimes looks Silver baby blue or a pretty pale green The 18 inch chrome wheels Pewter paint and black leather interior have people staring at this car everywhere I go and Ive heard nothing but compliments A recent 2000 mile road trip produced 30mpg at 45 27 at 55 and 2425 at 6570mph Not bad considering some of this was through the PA mountains No recalls rattles or problems
0,I have the performance engine and it is great I also like the chrome accents that are optional and the chrome wheels We get outstanding comments on this car The light leather interior is perfect
1,Have had the vehicle just over a year Like the space styling ride color redfireand handling Feels great to drive But a lot of cheap plastic Unprotected metal seat glides have sharp edges Seatbelt detectors balatantly visible From day 1 it has driftedpulled to the left Taken in numerous times told thats just the way it is Helicopter effect takes some getting used to even with front windows open Deep console is OK but you need to take everything out to get to the lower layer Cloth seats seem utilitarian like my old cheap truck Hate dark interiors so I like the stone color Lincolns very is overkill Wonder what a Mercury version would have been like
0,I had every intention of purchasing the 07 CXL with leather heated seats and all the goodies but the price tag seemed a bit steep I looked at a 2007 CX with 12111 miles on it no leather no heated seats but bought it anyway I am so glad I did because it is really a quiet well mannered car and I saved  dollar10K It is an absolute pleasure to drive and the fit and finish inside and out are excellent I am very happy with this car and believe it stacks up well compared to the equivalent Toyota and Honda
1,Went from midsize car Chrysler to the Edge First impressed with build quality and design Over time still not comfortable with the ride height Ford Flex looks better Seats are not as comfortable as when first driven The driver seat adjustment controls leave a lot be desired The blind spot due to APillar and mirror combination are daunting Backup warning system is a must when trying to navigate through small darkrear window Overall height makes loading the cargo area harder since items need to be lifter higher Engine is strong maybe too strong as experienced at full throttle torque steer is hard to fight Gas mileage range is 20 city   and 26 highway very good for the size
0,I have been in the car business for many years I have yet to find a car that handles this well or rides as quiet at the LaCrosse Happy with gas consumption as well If youre looking for a great roomy ride in this car class you just have to drive one
1,After almost a year with the Edge we went back to a loaded 2007 Town   and Country Gas mileage is the same and the TC is 2X the size inside The Edge is a great looking SUV but the interior build materials are simply horrible 1 large flat hard plastic piece after another And Ford was so cheap they painted many of the plastic interior pieces Any time you say touch the glove box with a kids school bag or a shoe it puts a nice scratch on it Our 18 rims were allready replaced after only 1 winter they were all pitted out Gas mileage is OK at 1819 in town and 2224 HWY but the huge TC van gets the same We simply couldnt live with the cheap KIA interior
0,We have had this car one month and love it We looked at the Accords and Camry but this car afford all the quailty and reliability with the benefit of added interior room The 38 engine provides tremendous torque and we can get 31 mpg highway It is very quiet and comfortable on the road
1,Big disappointment fuel mileage is really bad  never topped 18 mpg even on road trips We have been big Ford fans for a long time but this is most likely my last one Locked the car at the post office and could not get the drivers door to unlock  had to go to passenger side and reach across to unlock from inside Materials in cabin have a really cheap feel Air conditioner will not keep car cool in Texas heat Give me back my Expedition I gave up a lot to get 2 more miles out of a gallon of gas
0,The LaCrosse CXL is a real winner It is quiet and fun to drive on the freeway and good and responsive at city driving It has a very smooth suspension and quiet ride I recently travelled with friends and at the end of the trip everyone commented on how rested they felt
1,My wife and I have had this vehicle for almost a year and a half Not one problem Its never been back to the dealership Handles great rides like a car One the best new vehicles weve owned
0,This car is at the top of the heap as for as Im concerned Quiet the word here Plenty of power from the proven 38 V6 engine 28 mpg Styling comfort roadhandling all excellent A ton of car for the money  dollar24k sticker and lots of GM incentives make this a spectacular investment Finally GM has got it right with this one A lot of thought to details went into this vehicle Leasing is a very afordable option to owning this great car We just love this vehicle of all the previous cars we have owned
1,Did lots of research and thought Ford was really becoming competitive with foreign auto brandsWRONG From day one something was not right with my Edge The headlights were cracked from the inside upon purchase At 5000 miles the transmission felt off  searching for gears excessive shifting When the OD it struggled and revved too high At 8000 miles the tranny blew while I was driving on a mountain pass  I lost total control of the vehicle and was forced to use the E break to pull off the road The tranny was replaced but at 16000 miles it was dripping oil from the tranny again  this time an axle rod I told Ford I didnt feel safe   and was treated like an annoyance
0,Much improved over Century attractive interior quiet ride and lots of convenient gadgets fun to drive has all comforts and feel of larger car Very solid excellent finished product
1,I went from a Honda Odyssey to the Ford Edge and I could not be happier I am always being asked if I like the car or not by admirers and I cant stop raving about it I had transmission problems with the Honda since day one but my Edge is a year and a half and it runs perfectly I am happy to buy an American car from now on after this purchase
0,I have owned this car for 2 years and have had absolutely zero problems with it It does 0 to 60 in 9 seconds plenty fast enough for me and has a magnificent ride I have had several complements from total strangers on how beautiful it looks I have the blacked out grill with ming blue The aluminum wheels are nice Anybody who compares this car with an Avalon or Azela or Ford TaurusMercury Sable is completely out of their mind My only complaint is the fuel mileage I get 26 on the open road  not as good as the 29 I got with my 2000 LeSabre
1,This CUV is excellent looking and very nice we got the car and loved it we had an Expedition before so we decide to go for better gas mileage Well its been a year since we bought it and Im not impressed with it Im very forgiving when it comes to rating cars the little blemishes found on the brand new car shouldnt been there For an example the door handles had a little mat in the cavity to cover up the bolt showing was gone the first time we vacummed the car cheap and not the best way to design the car The plastic covers in the back gate lift gate comes off when I close the gate No foot rest for the driver
0,The car gives 28 miles per gallon The seats are very uncomfortable We have to use cushions to drive it Cant see the speedometer in the daytime It should be brighter still a nice car Trunk could be bigger
1,I have always gone with Honda to buy all my cars My husband was bored with this and seen a Ford Edge and had to buy I was nervous about this idea not anymore This is the best vehicle
0,I have owned many cars in my life but this Buick has almost everything from the OnStar to a custom paint job The comfort level is perfect and my mileage is 17 city 33 hwy I cant wait to buy one for my wife
1,We have had our Edge for just over a year now and the wife loves it We average 18mpg in city and anywhere from 2122mpg winter time to 2224mpg in the summer and have reached 26mpg a couple of times The ride seems rough when riding in the passenger seat compared to the driver seatjust my opinionwe had sirius installed after we purchased the vehicle and wife loves that also She like the looks and compares her edge to a less expensive looking lexus rx no problems with tire pressure monitoring system as mentioned in some reviews
0,Have over 22000 miles and love this Buick Have had zero problems Car is very comfortable and especially quiet I get 215 mpg in all around driving I find seats are very comfortable even after long trips It is a great car
1,I was rear ended by a Dodge Ram going 70 mph while I was at a stop This car was awesome My passenger and I walked away a little sore but we walked away My car is totaled now but Im in the process of buying a new one unfortunately they dont make the Dark Amethyst in the 2008s
0,Bought new Classy looks smooth and quiet ride fun to drive Satisfied with gas mileage eg 31mpg on highway and 195mpg suburban driving Blind spots at center and front roof supports DIC extremely helpful Dimming mirror great for night time driving Front seat lumbar supports too high Had to buy seat pillows for driver and front passenger seats Rear seats slanted too sharply making it hard to get outespecially for elderly OnStar system easy to use Only one repair was needed in 14 months steering
1,Great curb appeal and comfortable Thats about it City driving gas mileage averages around 15mpg  not much better than my 2004 Explorer Difficult to see outside or rear window  back headrests block view However most troubling is the constant whining which dealership attributes to the fuel pump Sorry they say there is nothing we can do Because its a new model Ford has little documentation on this problem
0,Bought this car new over a year ago Love the design smoothness   and quietness of ride Get 185205 mpg suburb driving and 2731 mpg on trips Reasonable pickup Arrive at distant destinations rested Somewhat difficult getting in and out especially for elderly Seating comfortable but non adjustable lumbar support too high Im 5lland seat seems short front to back A 2 12 seat pillow corrected the lumbar problem Roof supports create dangerous blind spots that took six  eight months to accommodate Inside trunk release button awkwardly located After 14000 miles no mechanical problems
1,We have had this vehicle for around three weeks now We brought a 2007 for the incentives and had an A plan that made the price hard to beat Problem is we are averaging 141 mpg My wife drives the car to work MF 15 miles highway driving We have asked other Edge owners what their average MPG is and the normal response is 20  25 Also window wipers freeze up and make the blades useless Where they are located is a collection area for rain and snow Not very well thought out Would strongly advise looking at other crossovers as this one cost more in gas than a Suburban would
0,Bought this car one year old when my Avalon started acting up down in Florida Drove 800 miles one day heading North never could have driven that far with my Avalon and the horrible seats This Lucerne is far superior to my old Avalon Have had new Caddys Saabs and my Toyota Avalon this is by far the best car I have owned
1,We purchased a dealer demo and a great price and we couldnt be happier This car drives and rides better than BMW or Lexus I drove to NC over mountains and got over 25mpg Have owned Ford for over 14 years and this is the best one yet My parents drove it when we got it and went out 2 days later and bought one and someone my husband works with test drove it and went out the next day and bought his wife one This CUV is quiet and has no trouble with pickup or speed A real family vehicle and you feel like you are driving a sports car Test drive oneyou wont be sorry
0,The Lucerne CXS is a very quiet comfortable sedan with decent handling The ride is soft smooth but predictable We and other riders are impressed with GMs OnStar performance as well Seats are comfortable and infinitely adjustable for tall or short drivers The NorthStar V8 under the hood is a GEM delivering quietsmooth solid power You get a Cadillac in sheeps clothing with the CXS Road trips are a pleasure
1,We fell in love with this car on the first sight and are still happy with it But there are some points that need to be addressed by Ford Our engine is whining as another reviewer described earlier A very annoying highpitch sound coming from the engine during acceleration and decelleration The gas mileage is worse than the window sticker promised We have hard time to make 18npg in the city traffic although we really try hard to drive as careful as possible A bearing broke after 3000 miles on flat road
0,Just turned 25000 miles today The computer says I should need my third oil change at around 30000 miles So far two oil changes have been 100 percent of all repairs and maint Has not been to the dealer since the day I picked it up How many Lexus owners can say that While almost no one knows what it is the styling is a little too bland all agree it looks inside and out like a modern luxury sedan Love the sound of the Northstar with dual exhaust Even with my less than gental driving I average over 19 mpg With  dollar325 gas I guess I would probably buy the v6 if I had to do it again however
1,This is a great vehicle Do not make the mistake of buying the Edge without the Vista roof I keep the sunshade open on sunny days and the tinting of the panels is still sufficent as to not bake in the seats The VR alone gives you the feeling of a much larger interior Very easy exitentry and provides great visibility height for those who are used to the view from an SUV Brake headrest and liftgate concerns from other reviews are non existant I will admit that there is a glare reflecting the dash onto the windshield when driving from my Camel interior but you have to be looking for it to notice
0,Bought this as a left over and got a good deal We replaced our 98 Regal GS with this car and have not been thrilled with the mpg The dealer tells us everything is working fine and there is nothing to fix the estimates are based on an outdated criteria that is not realistic We are averaging less than 20 mpg combined highwaycity Even on long trips we do not see an appreciable gain Otherwise the car is well made quiet and very comfortable bench seat in front and at 64 that is saying something For the first 1000 miles there was an annoying vibration int he front during breaking but as the dealer predicted this has gone away
1,We purchased a 2007 Ford Edge SEL Plus on 83107 Had less than 50 miles on it This car is fast and handles nicely Being a female I like that it doesnt drive like a truck I do have a serious complaint about this new Ford Edge For the last 3 weeks Ive been seeing red fluid on the ground where Ive parked My husband brought the car to Ford this week and the repair receipt shows CK red fluid leak right center firewall areaAC drain dripping on exhaust bracket causing red rust It turns out the bracket is rusted from the ACThe service guy at Ford said hes never seen anything like it He told us not to park on inclines on days we use the AC My driveway is on an incline
0,I love my new Lucerne however I do find it a little difficult to get in and out of Wish the trunk open button was is a move conivent place believe this has been changed for 2008 Wish there was a lock on gas door Open from inside of car and find it hard to use ATM from car
1,I was skeptical at first My husband actually picked out this vehicle I thought it looked a little strange but was willing to give it a try I tried out 3 different types of vehicles and I was sold on the Edge My teenagers love it and my 19 year old daughter bought one for her self We now have 2 in the driveway Every day someone says What is that Sticker prices were a bit higher than expected but we got an OK deal during yearend closeout specials I was disappointed to find out that those blingbling wheels were nothing more than plastic wheel covers
0,I have purchased several new Ford Taurus and one used Lincoln LS since 1988 The 2004 Lincoln LS does not have enough leg room in the back and even though it had bumper to bumper a wheel bearing drum and 3 rims were replaced Also a recall with a problem in the steering column I lost all confidence and decided to go with GM We purchased the last new 2007 CXL Lucerne after test driving the 2008 Sable and Taurus The Buick felt safer and is built better With the OnStar and other nice features including the depreciation differencewe are glad to have a well built comfortable and dependable car
1,My wife replaced her Sunfire GT with a new 2007 Escape Limited and this was her first new car she had ever purchased We looked at a Mazda 3 and a G6 but she decided on the Escape I dont care for SUVs but it did not take long for me to really start to like our Escape Limited The fit and finish along with the quality of the interior pieces was very nice The Escape is also very quiet and is even fun to drive on twisty roads Most SUVs have terrible steering feel poor onroad dynamics and noisy tires The Escape has none of those problems My wife loves her Escape and I have learned to love it as well It is the first SUV I have ever liked
0,I love cars and I am considered a car nut by everyone that knows me I have owned over thirty cars and have driven countless more in my persuit of the perfict one for me I never make a purchase without very extensive investigation If anyone ever told me that my favorite car would be a Buick I would instantly recommend they seek professional counseling The 2007 Buick Lucerne CXL is dollar for dollar pound for pound the best inexpensive 23000 car I have ever owned There is nothing on the market today that even comes close for the price I know because I drove everything in the price range of under 30000 including Nissan Toyota Honda Chevy Ford and Chrysler The car is irresistable
1,When i was going to buy this car i did about a years research and money saving put a good down payment down for it I knew exactly what i wanted color and everything i got the limited model and hooked it up I put 18 chrome wheels on it with the toung skin grey exterior and the black leather interior changed the silver dash accents to silver burlwood blue led lights in side and out The no temp gauge thing bothered me also so i installed a rear view mirror with it in itFold out indash recever 3 tvs with Two 12 inch JBL speakers in a custom box changed all the speakers to kenwood components and remote start It really turns heads when im driving it and i get alot of compliments
0,Bought it because it was pretty and felt comfortable After a week of driving to and from work 40 miles per day my lower back began to hurt After three weeks I was unable to drive the car Driver and passenger seats have no lumbar support Back seat is comfortable Traded cars with my husband He now has to drive with cushions on back of seat Dealer was of no help They recommended having an upholsterer rebuild the seats which we will try We like the very quiet ride and many of the features Headliner is of poor design with raw edges front and back Cup holder design is poor
1,I wasnt even looking for an Escape when I started shopping and ending up there on chance because the Toyota dealer messed me over and I walked out Anyway I was surprised by the performance look and feel of the 2007 Escape It has been a great ride over the past year The only thing I have noticed is breaking really hard is a little sluggish but over all a great ride I am very happy with my 2007 Escape
0,Dollar for dollar this car is the best in its class I purchased a base model for about  dollar23000 and at that price none of the other vehicles mentioned was even close in ride power or equipment The Chrysler 300 in that price range is incredibly spartan in the interior and has a seriously underpowered 27L V6 While the 300 and Toyota handle better this is clearly due to both vehicles wider stance and lower profile tires which necessarily create a rougher ride If the owner simply wants a powerful quiet smooth riding car rather than one which will take exit ramps at 60 mph the Lucerne is it
1,The Escape appears to be reliable transportation But not much else Driving this used Escape from Enterprise I can see where Ford cuts corners to keep costs down Plastic interior looks cheap And it is The sound actually echos around inside the hardshell interior Motor is weak AC is strong Very good AC Wheelbase is too short for a vehicle this tall and this heavy The car bounces and porposes down the road It feels tippy Would not give this car to an inexperienced driver ie teenager Poorly designed cargo area There is a metal arm on each side which extends 7 or 8 into the cargo space when the seats are down Rear seat forward tilt only They do not fold flat
0,Owned this vehicle for a week now Great ride Quiet cabin interior Has all the options that I was looking for in a luxury car It is like I am riding on air Engine is quiet and I barely notice itonly in high exceleration Ride is smooth and car handles well in traffic Recently JDP has given this 2007 Buick Lucerne a favorable quality rating with Lexus No problem operating the features of the car and handles well on the highway and so far good milege in the city Some consumers have made quality complaints about their car and I have yet to experience them Overall so far no lemon here Again for me this is a fine luxury car not at the high end price
1,Blazing Copper Great looking vehicle good ergonomics except the arm restcenter console and cup holders My wife cannot use because it is too far back Gas mileage not as good as sticker suggests about 1922 with 5050 highwaycity driving Transmission can sometimes jerk into gear Also when needing to merge on freeway its like breaking then jerking into gear Need to work on that It is as if the vehicle has trouble deciding which gear it wants Handling is great tight turning radius easy to park and lots of room
0,Traded in 1999 Park Avenue Ultra I have bought many new cars in the last 40 years This Lucerne I feel is by far the finest one of all Great comfort good fuel ecomy Took trip with crise on and got 275 miles to the gallon A very enjoyable car to own and drive Extremely quiet and a joy to drive
1,I love my 2007 Escape Its fun to drive looks sharp and I get a lot of comments on it The only thing I would change is the dashboard I prefer digital info on the radio such as temp fuel range etc but that is not an option on mine I would also put more numbers on the speedometer Its a little difficult to tell if I am driving 65 or 70 because of the limited numbers listed Other than that I am very happy with my vehicle
0,I have had SUVs for the past 10 years the ride from my CXL is impressive The standard features in the CXL are admirable I am not impressed with the fuel economy at this point in time A well constructed quality auto
1,This is my first Ford so I was a little apprehensive and I also went from a V6 to a 4 cylinder but it has more power than I expected and Im enjoying the gas mileage Its quite roomy for a compact SUV and the new warranty made the sale I really like the styling and I like that it handles like a car but youre riding up high like a truck As a single person its what I need  the look and feel of an SUV without the enormous price of one
0,For once a hasty decision on my part turned out good Upon leaving my sisters home after a two week visit and having my old car all packed to return to Florida it wouldnt start Id had problems with it before Sister screams at me to buy a new car I remembered my nephew a day earlier telling me about the Buick Lucerne A car with class and enough room for my 65 frameI dismissed his opinion Ive never thoughtabout owning a Buick Sister dialed a family friend and handed me the phone Turned out to be a salesman for the Buick dealer I was so stressed i told him to work me a deal and he did a LucerneThe return trip to Florida was fantastic I love the car
1,I am a true car person I have owned way to many new cars over the years and this is truly the best The first thing to do for gas mileage is to change the air filter to the K  andN Use Mobil 1 oil and my mileage has ran as high as 41MPG when trying I get a constant 30MPG when my wife drives and that is great She just drives and does not worry about mileage She has never gotten any better than 17MPG with any other car that she has had both large and small cars of many makes and models Thank you Ford for taking a large step for fuel The others have a lot of catching up to do Ford rules
0,I absolutely love my Lucerne Ive had foreign and domestic cars but decided to come back to American made cars I researched and compared approx 5 vehicles before chosing the Lucerne and all of my friends and family love it as well I get told from teenagers that its a hot car all the way to people in their 70s plus who just love it Out of all the cars Ive ownedand thats been many this is my very very favorite I wish I could buy one for everyone I know so they could have as much fun as I do Its like driving a Cadillac on a smart budget You get all the comfort bells and whistles while being able to keep some money in your pocket Go Buick You did great
1,The 2007 Hybrid FWD is rated at 36mpg in the city Dont believe it Almost all my driving is in the city I get only 2324mpg Even turning the AC off adds only 1mpg The Ford dealer said it needed to be driven for 20003000 miles to be broken in before the mileage would improve After 5000 the mileage is still the same I know you never get the rated mpg but 30 percent less is fraud
0,I have only had the car since July but I enjoy driving it It is a very quiet and smooth riding car So far the mileage has been good
1,Ive owned Toyotas for 20 years and love my Prius but Toyota blew it with the Highlander Hybrid Its too big and the mileage just isnt good enough In college I swore Id never own another American car but the Escape Hybrid turned me around Its brilliant With the 4WD it goes anywhere I want including rough dirt roads and deep snow and it gets 50 percent better mileage than my old 4 runner Ive tried to break it I took it fast and fully loaded up a steep mountain highway to see if I could run the battery down no way It just works I get an honest 2830 MPG average with the 4WD Avoid the factory Nav system Buy a Garmin instead
0,This car has all of the bells and whistles OnStar is great and I love satellite radio built in Comfortable seats and stylish interior The outside of the car looks sharp It has the quiet tuning so it is smooth and quiet inside the car Just a real elegant sophisticated driving experience American made quality with refined luxury Im only 36 and all of my friends rag on me for getting a Buick but now that I own one I see why all of the older guys out there buy them over an over again
1,I am getting 35 miles a gallon yet I am driving a SUV that is comfortable and looks good It does not get better than that I am looking to buy a second used Escape No serious complaints however it would be nice if you could add the MP3 option to the factory Navigationradio setup The 2008 might be quieter but I like the looks for the 2007 better
0,We purchased our Buick Lucerne on May 10th The Buick Lucerne with the 3800 V6 Series III engine was the best choice for our needs In June we made a 2035 mile trip to North Carolina We enjoyed a most confortable ride it was quiet and with the added secure feeling provided by the OnStar system Today fuel economy is important and on 1379 mile of mostly Interstate we averaged 302 MPG and on 656 miles of rurual travel we averaged 274 MPG I was pleased with this performance on our first road trip The Lucerne is definitely in the class with the Avalon and Chrysler 300
1,Bought this to replace a 95 Grand Cherokee and an 04 Grand Prix Mileage has varied from 26mpg freeway to 33mpg city Power from a stop is a little weak Passing power is very capable Ride is a little bouncy Handling is a little unstable above 70mph Below that its acceptable for an SUV Cabin is a little noisy but no worse than the Grand Prix Headroomlegroom in both front and back are good Im 62 and even with the moonroof I still have headroom 4 wheel disc brakes are very good but have an odd nonlinear feel to them Any doubts about it Ask for a 24 hour test drive One day of commuting with it sold me on the Ford Escape Hybrid
0,This Buick is a very nice road car and rides very well The fuel economy is very good also The appointments are also very well coordinated However the memory on the seats and outside mirrows were not a very easy learning process
1,I liked the interior   and exterior design and wanted to do the right green thing so I spent the extra dollars on the 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid Now Im extremely disappointed with the 21 mpg city driving it provides Certainly not the 33 mpg advertised I drain the little 15 gallon tank in no time It stinks
0,I love the comfort in my car I am in sales and bring many clients out and I hear all the time this is a Buick or Thats an American Car A few of my friends that bought other cars will say they wish they had riden with me first before they made their purchase I also love that I get an email each month telling me where I am with tire pressure oil and other maintenance My wife will trade in our BMW X5 for the new Enclave
1,I decided upon this as it met my needs for room mileage and price Ive had others say that Toyota makes 3 hybrids and that they are better In all honesty 20 years ago that was true but not now I did my research and could not justify the extra  dollar dollar difference So far I have not regretted my decision
0,Had vehicle one week and it broke down bad wiring at factory Had it towed and problem resolved Not happy with gas mileage Traded a 2000 Cadillac which had same type engine Northstar V8 Hopefully the Buick will measure up in time since gas prices are up
1,We looked at the 2008 sneakpeek pics and the LA auto show writeups   and pics but we decided we liked the 2007 interiorexterior design best because it looks less trucklike than the new designs My wifes the primary driver and she loves this vehicle In the first 500 miles neither of us have any buyers remorse
0,This is a great car to drive very very quiet great sound quality with the XM radio CD and IPOD The car offers a lot of space even in the back I love the styling Turn by turn navigation is great My wife titled the car Flying Sofa as riding it is like sitting in your living room This car replaced a 2003 Mercedes ML350
1,Car is generally OK Gas mileage less than advertised  no surprise  but far better than my SUV we traded in Interior has little storage and few amenities Air conditioning compressor shuts down when the car is powered by the electric motor only causing extreme discomfort in Houston summer traffic jams and at stop lights Can get around it by going to Max AC manually but then youre on the gas engine considerably reducing gas mileage This is not a car for hot humid climates
0,Buick has really got it right with the Buick Lucerne The ride comfort quality and quiet rival luxury cars costing thousands of dollars more This car offers many features found on only the most expensive luxury cars You get the big car feel when driving this car The quiet ride is very impressive GM has a winner here They need to get this vehicle in front of the public I have received many positive comments from people when I have been fueling my car If you are looking for real luxury at a non luxury price the Buick Lucerne should be at the top of your list of cars to consider
1,By far the best driving vehicle I have owned Its CVT transmission is seamless and unless you are watching the tach you would never even notice when it switches between gas and electric operation I dont understand the criticism that a hybrid owner wont save gas money It was costing us  dollar80 every five days to fill my 23 gallon van to go 300 miles Now I fill my 15 gallon tank to go 450 miles By a conservative estimate I am saving  dollar200 every month in gas
0,I have owned this CXS for a month and I love it The magnetic ride control and huge tires on this model provides a far better ride than my 2006 Caddy STS that I traded This is a great highway cruiser Very comfortable and extremely quiet Youre getting a DTS Cadillac chasis and engine at a Buick price The white gold flash tricoatfinish and the beautifully finished chrome wheels makes this a real headturner and I have had several favourable comments from passers by Truly GM isnt doing itself any favours by hardly advertising this Buick It is the best car I have owned If you are considering a Lexus E350 or full size Chrysler Hemi this car warrants a test drive
1,I picked up my 2007 hybrid last week and love it Its a little more noisy that my Mercedes ML320 was but a lot quieter than our Nissan Xterra I got  dollar500 off the sticker which is rare given the demand for these The only thing I dont like is the lack of a satellite radio option on the highend navigationradio system Oh well I think there will be a lot of other SUV hybrids soon so this car is to hold me a few years until something I like comes out I wasnt going to shell out  dollar60K for the Lexus hybrid
0,Looked at Toyota Avalon and Ford 500 as well as the Lucerne but continued to go back to Lucerne and traded my 2003 LeSabre for the 2007 Lucerne CXL Rides like a dream highway mileage is great city not so good but no terrible for a car this size Fit and finish outstanding and the body style turns heads Get lost of compliments A relative liked mine so well he just purchased one as well
1,We really enjoy our EL It is fun safe roomy quiet gives us about 19 mpg on the highway at 7080 mph It gives us about 138 around the city and Ill pay for the gas for the added safety of the F150 chassis The visibility is excellent great mirrors and backup sensors make you look like a pro when parking The turning radius is better than many small cars The Limited is about 10K cheaper than the Linclon Navigatior and I cant see the value in the Navigator The Ford gives you everything you need You cant go wrong with this vehicle Its worth every cent of the extra fuel that you burn over a crappy little car that you will learn to hate
0,I have just purshased this vehicle It gives the most quiet ride I have had in any automobile I have owned It provides ample room inside
1,My right front brake caliper failed at less than 41000 miles resulting in approx  dollar70000 in repairs Ford Motor Company denied any assistance for the repairs on a vehicle that is TWO YEARS OLD  I understand that the vehicle was 4000 miles over warranty however this is a NEW vehicle I am curious to see if any other Expedition owners have a similiar story to tell Fords poor treatment of a long time customer has me doubting my brand loyalty I am totally dissatisfied with their handling of my situation and advised them I would be sharing my experience with other consumers
0,This is the fifth Buick I have owned and is by far the best assembled The ride is firmer than other Buicks I have had and it makes driving more fun
1,I bought this SUV due to having an older expedition and loving it We wanted a little more room and 4 WD I was worried about fuel and mileage but not worried anymore I love the leather and the dvd system Plenty of storage even when the 3rd row seat is up I recommend this SUV to anyone
0,Great ride and handling Great styling Sportier looking than Toyota Avalon or Cadillac DTS two of my other considerations Lots of head and leg room both front and rear and Im 61 Interior layout is great all cotrols are right where they should be Quality is first class Not one problem to report after six months of ownership Forget the Northstar V8 and stick with the 3800 V6 engine Its a solid engine with a long track record I had it in my 92 LeSabre and it was still going strong at 200000 miles Getting around 22 MPG in town and averaged 31 MPG highway on a recent 700 mile trip
1,I bought this SUV and loved the interior room Drives nicely and feel safe on every driveI was worried about the Fuel Economy however it is only 1 mile less per gallon than my Toyota Sienna I do not even notice the mileage difference Would highly recommend this vehicle
0,This car is a headturner It has as much or more style as a much more expensive luxury car The optional packages are loaded with great features and are a terrific value The interior is roomy and comfortable The controls are within easy reach attractive and laid out nicely It has a quality fit look and feel The standard sound system is exceptional and OnStar is a lifesaver  it has an integrated phone and navigation service The cars exterior does not look cheap I would prefer if it didnt have the side vents but Ive gotten used to them It is a solidly made car I wish the car had a little more power and a 5 or 6 speed transmission
1,We leased this vehicle in December of 06 as soon as it hit the showroom We dont have a bunch of kids and use it strictly to go back and forth from our vacation home The vehicle does not hold up well even with just 2 adults We have had carpet pull loose twice an armrest break and something happens occasionally at stop lights that feels like another car rear ended us The dealership tells us they have never heard of this although other owners Expeditions have been known to do this also Very underpowered for a vehicle of this size We dont haul with it have an F250 for that so I cant think of any excuse Really glad its a lease cant wait to turn it in Going back to GM
0,Many features are very difficult to master Even the seat controls are difficult to master The width of the drivers floorboard is not wide enough for comfort and seem to crunch large feet I do like many of the features such as backup warnings and overall appearance If I had the purchase to do over I would select a different vehicle
1,I find this vehicle to be a bit uncomfortable and the fuel economy is unacceptable as far as Im concerned Unless you have money to burn I would consider a different SUV
0,Fun car Took to the dealer for a minor adjustment 2400 miles They did a recall on the remote control Today the ABS warning light the traction control warning light and the tire pressure monitor warning light came on and stayed on Now we will see if the dealer can undo the miscue Slightly less getupandgo of my LeSabre Otherwise I am pleased with the overall performance and looks of the car
1,On our way to CO from TX we got a chance to test AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control I could easily say this technology saved our lives 8 adults WITH luggage It was dark and a few deer showed up in front of us We were going 80mph and my sister instinctively threw the steering wheel sharply to the right I immediately braced for rollover because a maneuver like that would have surely flipped us over but it did not While we fishtailed violently in the aftermath my sister needed only to hold the steering wheel straight The car regained control soon after and we were all amazed at how it did it To think what could have happened if this feature hadnt come standard is frightening
0,Close tolerences Beautifully toned exhaust pipes and 275 powerful horses for get up and go Put that with a quiet ride a super suspension a Karmon Harman sound system and you have a great car for under  dollar4000000 Its built in one of the manufacturing facilities in the country the BOC Plant in Hamtramak MI It matches up favorably with my Lincoln Mark VIII Chrysler 300 and Missan Maxima Try it You might like it
1,This is our first SUV after a series of three minivans The Explorer is very well built with no rattles or squeaks Since it is built on a truck frame the ride can be a little rough on certain terrain I really wanted a Tahoe but the Eddie Bauer Explorer comparably equipped was 10K less It is a little smaller vehicle but for 10K it was worth the difference
0,I looked first at comparable Japanese cars and discovered GM still does many things better This Buick performs and rides excellently is quiet and comfortable Its design is not as spectacular as Chrysler 300 but has a feel of quality
1,I owned an Explorer previously and it was great Something went seriously wrong with this model Since I have had it 9 months I have had the ebrake handle break the rear struts go out the seat belt actually come apart and my drivers seat control panel fall completly off I didnt even have my car back a week from the mechanic and then this morning water came leaking through the buttons for the reading lightsand no I did not leave my sunroof open The dealership said one of the drain tubes for the sunroof must have a problem and they would need if for at least three days So if you cannot tell no I would not recommend this vehicle nor would I recomend any Ford prior to 2004
0,This car had some vibration when new but cleared up in a few days Very nice car Highway trip fuel economy not fully tested yet Not powerful but entirely adequate
1,Ive owned a lot of Fords and this is the worst The V8 with the 6 speed transmission lurches from 1st to 2nd gear and again when slowing it feels like youve been rear ended Ford has issued a lot of TSBs and none can fix the problem Dealer wont or cant do anything for you and Ford is playing the deaf ear Mines been in the shop 6 times had a Ford engineer confirm the problem and they still wont buy the darn thing back Im going the Lemon Law route to get them to take the lemon back Too bad for Ford
0,Buick is back I own a 2007 Lucerne CXS and with the Northstar v8 and the magnetic ride suspension it rides and handles better that the Lexus I had and is quieter too Mileage with the V 8 is around 20 mpg for me with a combo of intown and highway driving On the road doing 80 I get around 24in town around 18 No creaks or squeaks yet this is the most solid feeling car Ive ever owned
1,I traded my 98 Expedition in on my new Eddie Bauer Explorer I loved my Expedition and had a hard time giving it up Have been driving the Explorer for a little over a month now and no major complaints this truck is pretty awesome My rear headrests fold down so no obstruction visually The looks of the Explorer inside and outside I really like more so than any other midsize SUV I looked at A friend of mine bought one and I guess seeing it a lot it sort of grew on me His roof console came loose a few months after he bought it but the dealer took care of it no charge So far so good with this vehicle
0,We love our new Lucerne except for the air noise that comes in through the windows We purchased it for fuel economy comfort and the advertised guarantee of quietness We average about 24 MPG on the road and it is comfortable But the doorwindow design must be flawed because the air noise that comes through the windows at speeds over 45 mph is awful It is like driving in a wind tunnel The dealership promises to replace the gaskets around both of the front doors so we hope that this helps Just make sure that you test drive on a highway where you can drive over 45 MPH before you buy this vehicle
1,We have not owned the Explorer long but so far we love it We really planned on buying a Tahoe but we bought the Explorer similarly loaded for  dollar9000 less Of course the Tahoe is a little bigger and we actually thought it drove just a little better than the Explorer but not 9K worth The Explorer seems solid as a rock no rattles or squeaks whatsoever
0,I replaced a 2004 Park Avenue with a 2007 Lucerne big mistake The Lucerne is far smaller than a Park Avenue The interior is a joke It is so cheaply done as soon as you sit in it for a month you begin to feel like your setting in a Kia Buick made their first mistake back in 1996 when they dropped the Roadmaster and now they have really gone looney by dropping the Park Avenue The interior room in the Lucerne is so small I felt like I was in a circus car and clowns should have been in there with me Go with a Lincoln Town Car The Lucerne is a big mistake treat yourself with a true luxury car go with the Lincoln Town Car
1,Just bought mine this month and its a nice car but there could be some improvement Like the floor mounted shifter gets in the way when Im driving and trying to change the AC setting or when Im trying to look for on coming traffic and the oversized rear headrest get in the way both 2nd and 3rd row And there seem to be a little bit of lag in the 6 cylinder engine in range acceleration Other than that everything else is good and since I keep the 3rd seat folded down I can at least see out of the rear window Rear quarter windows are a different story
0,Buick Lucerne CXL was the best quality and greatest value I drove the Cadillacs Acura TL Chrysler 300 both Toyota sedans and even the Azera This sedan is loaded with extras provides great fit and finish and is truely and luxury car I researched every car and read the reviews but I think if the car is not an import the published reviews are not as good I now belive the car press is not open minded about the American made cars This sedan is worth a drive and you will be surprised at the quality and features
1,We just bought a Eddie Bauer V6 Traded up from an 02 Sport Trac It rides so much better than the Sport Trac We did not get all the goodies but what we got for our money was a very good value Looking forward in 3 years to getting a 2010 model It will be here soon
0,Dead quiet Smooth as silk on the road Great handling for this size of car
1,My lease is finally over I really enjoyed this wanna be truck too bad the gas mileage was not great 16 mpg on a good week of city driving I wish the new 2009 was out but not at the dealer yet Two things need to improve the gas mileage and the small compartments in the bed should be waterproof and with locks of some kind I am really gonna miss this one
0,Puchased 31 of October Week later antifreeze spilled all over the road Brought back for service They replaced thermostat and gasket Found gas pedal and steering wheel vibrates like a cell phone in vibration mode when going uphill Four times in dealership no result Still vibrates Dealer replaced motor mounts 2 times Finaly he gave up and indicated that this is design of the car and nothing can be done My foot going numb after 2 hours of driving Going to return this car under lemon law Very disapointed with Buick Never buy Buick again
1,I previously owned a 2004 Sport Trac the 2007 version is a much better vehicle quieter quicker better handling and more roomy When I drive down the highway the Limited edition is as tall if not taller than many F150s and Chevy trucks The handling is carlike The Sport Trac does well in snow and rain where the 2004 felt like it could get away at any time
0,Great auto I get 32 mpg with great comfort and security Why buy foreign More value than competion
1,All things equal I like this truck a lot It does what I wanted it to do and 21 mpg on the highway is slightly better than what I thought Id get Power is good comfort is good not great cloth seats However there are a couple things Im a little irritated by The tailgate has literally come off in my hands four times in the past year and Im told thats the way it was designed to come off easily so it could be replaced with the tailgates that allow air to flow through dont know the term for them Thats fine but this is very very poorly thought out The tailgate should not accidentally come off there should be a latch or other device that needs to be disabled first
0,If a quiet comfortable ride is priority one Lucerne CX will exceed expectations Built on the same platform as Cadillac DTS it isolates the driver from minor road problems while Avy   and Azera do not The Buick engineers have found the perfect balance between ride comfort and control in the CX model For those who favor control over comfort the CXL has 17 tires and a firmer suspension yet delivers a great ride that is not harsh Auto Level is standardall models and enhances the ride with any kind of load The engine and transmission smootly deliver performance as neededquietly and without a hint of the hesitation mentioned in other new cars Highway mileage is 30 MPG
1,I wasnt even looking at Ford Thought I would look at the Explorer and ended up driving it off the lot I was initially very impressed with car still am sort of It has just had too many problems Transmission is horrible It keeps shifting as I decellerate to a stop Very jerky tranny Ford said they were aware of the problem but didnt have a fix They eventually reprogrammed the transmission which worked for a while but its acting very jerky again Have had issues gear shifter and exterior lights too I may have just gotten a bad one nonetheless Im not buying another Ford
0,I absolutly love the car Its great looking and handles like a dream in the mountains Gas milage is wonderful for a car this size  over 20 in town and over 30 on the road and I dont baby it I did put red line oil products in it like i do everything I drive but the car is in my opinion just great Ive had 6 Caddys Devilles and this car will not only beat them in a race but I think its more comfortable and is aproximately  dollar20000 msrp cheaper so how good is that What a value
1,I purchased a 2003 Sport Trac XLT and kept it for three years with 12000 miles per year Like it so well that I went and purchased a 2007 Limited with a V8 and like it even better
0,This is a great road car fun to drive and very quiet inside The seats are very comfortable Not much left to wish for in a car of this price range A lot of bang for your buck
1,I am not really sure what the reviewers think they are driving but my Sport Trac handles well both on the highway and off road Road repair in my area is mostly bad and the Sport Trac handles all of it very well Off road in the 4x4 Low setting and the V8 engine it simply powers its way up what ever rut trail Ive traveled on As for the cabin space I am over 6 foot and I find quite roomy as does the rest of my family of four It has excellent pickup for a truck its size from standing starts and it gives the power to pass with a full trailer load as well I am very satisfied with my Sport Trac
0,My 2007 CX Buick has a lot of wind noise starting at 45 MPH I have driven several and all have some degree of noise but mine is the worst The fix is turn the radio on
1,This is my first Ford after years of GM and Honda I must say that I like my Sport Trac better than my wifes Pilot The drivers seating seems to have been designed for me I am very comfortable driving this vehicle Build quality is great and the vehicle is very tight I have not had a single issue since I bought this truck Gas mileage could be better  but it could be worse
0,I just purchased the Lucerne and it is a great car I test drove all the different models and the CXS is not even comparible to the others Its drive far surpasses the lower models and drives like a dream The V8 is not going to beat up the muscle cars but its not supposted to either It is very smooth and runs great
1,Before purchasing this vehicle I test drove the Honda Ridgeline I needed a truck to handle small chores so I checked out an F150 but it was more than my pocket would allow The Sport Trac is just what I needed Great ridevery roomy and the bed is big enough for the small chores I need to accomplish The six cylinder engine provides me with enough power A great value for the money The Honda Ridgeline is a bit pricey and very hard to see out of the rear window even though I did like the large compartment in the bed I was really impressed with the Sport Tracs ride and inside headroom
0,My only disappointment is that the city mileage and I drive conservatively is only 17 vs the 21 I got from my 2000 LeSabre Highway driving is about 27 A nice car to own and drive
1,Not a bad ride My 4WD unit rides nice and handles well Traction control works great Mileage hovers right around those listed  even better sometimes on the highway The sound system in mine 6 CD stereo w MP3 playback sounds really good Mine has the power pedals but they hardly get used
0,Just purchased a few days ago Excellent fit and finish and very comfortable interior Smooth ride
1,Have owned this vehicle for about a month now Looked at other vehicles but decided on this one for several reasons The V8 is OK but could use more bottom end torque Runs good up high but should pull better down low Mileage is disappointing even considering the type of vehicle it is Good transmission Quite comfortable Wish I would have got the reverse sensing Not easy to back up Pulls 4200 lb boat quite well Overall a good vehicle but the low first gear in the transmission doesnt make up for the relatively poor low end torque The 54 litre motor would be a better choice if was available Mileage would be about the same Still the 46 is better than V6
0,This is my fourth Buick since 1989 including 2 LeSabres and a Park Avenue The quietness of my test drive convinced me to buy The luxuriouness of interior and exterior are impressive for the money Handling with 17inch wheels is a plus I love to drive it
1,I special ordered my Sport Trac with 95 percent of the options to include the Chrome Package reverse sensors Class IIIIV tow package V8 leather interior etc The ST fits comfortably in the garage so you dont have to leave it parked out on the driveway I will be using my truck to pull motorcycles trailers and for any other utility need that we might have My only complaint is that it would be nice to get slightly better gas mileage but you cant win em all
0,This car has great features a great ride and great looks Quiet as a Lexus
1,I am a large person and I am very comfortable in the truck My wife says the same Handles and runs great Having trouble finding accessories for the 2007 Sport Trac Every one tells me not for another 2 to 3 months
0,This car has done everything the manufacture said it would and has better gas mileage than claimed 202 city34 highway It is the quietest auto I have ever owned Steering precise excellent power solid handling You can whisper to each other at 80mph in this car with no problem hearing There is ample leg room in the rear seat area for a 6ft  Man superior thigh support excellent back supportThe ride is very comfortable and complements the handlingI am not at all disapointed in this car It has exceeded my expectations After 5000 miles I just cant wait till tomorrow morning for the drive to work
1,The interior is not well designed The door opener is ok but the grip on the door is awkward its hard to grab to keep the door from swinging too far and at a bad position to close The interiorexterior temperature gauges are small and hard to read The message center is in the middle of the dash but the speedo is hard to read through the steering wheel The parking brake release is hard to reach and cramped There is no indication on the dash as to what gear youre in There is no way to manually shift out of the overdrives The flipover rack was bent and the locks wouldnt work When you flip the larger back seat down there is a big gap between the back of the seatcab
0,Really  to keep the miles off the Ferrari but help with MPG I bought the new Lucerne and am selling my Lexus GX40 SUV I first drove a Lucerne in the spring but I was not sure I looked at the BMW 5s the M Infinitis Lexus Chrysler MBs and Lincoln sedans The Lucerne finally won me over when they added the new GPS Nav systems
1,Bought the truck with 2 miles on it in 2007 Dont get me wrong I love my truck and I have had 2 F150 before this one but it had been in the shop 5 times since I have had it The first time it was a window gasket It has had two starters and now it is in the shop getting a new flywheel It only has 30  miles on it Even after all this stuff I still love it and would not trade it for anything else
0,Bought the 07 in quartz metallicWOW what a looker Ride is superb and comfort   and spaciousness best I have ever seenI have owned Mercedes in the past
1,This is my 6th F150 Supercrew 54 v8 373 limited slip rearend chrome package Dark shadow graysilver on bottom skid plates and few other goodies Current mileage 17K This is a great truck Ive had an entire pallet of ceramic tile3000LBSin the bed of this truck and the only noticeable difference was the truck sat level instead of nose down Average 1213mpg city and 18520mpg highway Only one minor problem during a cold spell this winter the 4X4 acuator on the front axle wouldnt engage Dealer found water in acuator and it had frozen Dealer replaced it in a few hours I was back in the mud
0,The workmanship inside and out is beyond anything Id have expected from a US car manufacturer Mechanically the vehicle is beyond anything I expected from the car it blows you away Fit finish performance and comfort are unbelievably superior I call it the top of the line Caddy without the steroids
1,This is my third f150 I have always liked them I purchased this truck new and around 16000 miles I noticed a tapping noise from the engine The dealer said it was the fuel injectors Ive never heard noisy fuel injectors before So when winter arrived and I started the truck the noise was even louder than before and when the accelerator is pressed the tapping became quicker Dealer inspected ran tests for a week and finally called in their Ford rep who advised me that it is a characteristic of the f150 The salesperson didnt advise me of this trait I asked what characteristic could I expect in another year or two Guess what No answer
0,Worthy successor to the LeSabrePark Avenue The CXS has plenty of room excellent build quality perfect ergonomics and a smooth quiet ride I have received many positive comments about the car including the cocoacashmere interior which is new for 07 I checked out an Avalon and the quality and ergonomics of the Lucerne are superior And no recalls for steering failure or reported transmission issues that have plagued the Avalon The Northstar delivers turbinelike power with no audio drama You step on the gas and it moves The steering is tight and direct which makes this much more of a drivers car than the Ultra while still a very comfortable cruiser on the open road
1,This is my 4th F150 Lariat since 2000 and probably the worst Lariat Chrome edition Ive had it for 2 years now and its been in and out of the shop on many occasions for engine bogginess 54L transmission problems transmission has now been rebuilt brake problems 2 brake jobs already backup sensor problems replaced 2 so far My lease expires in less than a year Thank God Ive had enough I dont think I will be leasing another Ford truck again
0,Excellent ride room and reliability Great mpgs for a car this size Amazingly quiet Traded a trouble prone 5 series BMW for this one
1,I traded in my 06 Chevy Silverado that was tricked out for my Ford I wanted the bigger engine because mine was a 46 My neighbor talked me into to it The interior of the Ford is overall sexier than Chevy The FX2 edition comes with the body kit Although I would have liked the Titan Ford gave me more bang for my buck For the price I paid for my FX2 I would have only gotten a base model Titan I lost a little bit of towing but I will never tow that much so in reality I bought a truck that even my wife isnt afraid to drive Now I just have to ask her can I drive my truck sometime
0,Smooth and quiet ride just what you would expect from Buick The features of am import luxury car in an SUV
1,I have owned my F150 Lariat for a year now I am coming up on 15000 miles and have had one very minor problem a power window switch it was fixed at no charge with no hassle I read in many reviews about a lack of power and a sluggish feeling My F150 has the heavy duty suspension limited slip 373 gear ratio and really doesnt do too bad It has a very smooth powertrain that delivers horsepower evenly throughout the RPM range Under normal conditions you dont feel the acceleration then all of a sudden you notice that your doing 80MPH If I want to accelerate quickly I click off the overdrive and it gets right with it Im averaging 1516 MPG mixed hiwaycity driving
0,Have been incredibly pleased with all aspects of this SUV The smooth and quiet of the ride are not like an SUV Plenty of power in the I6 Dollar value was outstanding It is unfortunate that Buick is not continuing the Rainier
1,Great truck I bought it as a work truck base model Could not be happier Im so glad I didnt spend the extra money for features not needed The truck has been flawless
0,We were looking at the Acacia when the dealer showed us the Rainier The value for the Rainier was exceptional We towed our boat on a 2000 mile excursion through the Sierras and it pulled with very little problem Comfortable seats quiet and smooth ride The fold back rear seat headrests help with vision when no one is riding in the back The built in air compressor is a plus urning radius is very tight
1,In over 16000 miles Ive had no problems with this truck Add a few extras and its a beast
0,I got My Rainier by way of a factory order and toured the factory where it was made in Moraine Ohio This vehicle is flat out awesome It has a smooth ride and does not have a flat out truck feel at all Its the quietest I have ever owned I have no regrets getting this one Just too bad Buick is dropping this model after the 2007 year ends Things that need more publicity are DVD Navigation and Onstar Turn by Turn Navigation standard on the 2007 Buick line Having both on the same vehicle makes long trips a breeze The Voice control of the navigation system is a really great feature The factory DVD Navigation can be added later with the Delphi TNR800 Unit from Crutchfield
1,This truck is a serious machine Ive driven GM trucks for decades After being tired of replacing transmissions and large repair bills after 100000 miles I decided to give the Blue Egg boys a shot his truck does not disappoint I believe the GM might be slightly quicker in 060 but put a trailer on the back and youll appreciate the Fords torque advantage Guys  Quit wondering Go get one
0,The last 3 SUVs weve owened were all Oldsmobile Bravadas which was a step above the Envoy and step below a Cadillac When Oldsmobile closed the Buick division cloned the Bravada with the Rainier After recently buying the Rainier we were pleasantly surprised at how beautiful this truck truly is The ride is great performance great and totally compares to the Bravada Buick came a long way when they created this truck Not an old mans vehicle anymore
1,I love the truck itself its easily the nicest looking truck on the road Ive only had mine for three weeks but its going into the shop to be repainted because someone at the Dearborn plant didnt know how to paint On three parts of the truck there are paint flaws Not just flaws but actual debris in the paint like little specks of sand were on the truck when it was painted Because of this this is the last Ford I buy The consumer shouldnt have to be forced QA department So yeah  awesome truck awful fit and finishWord to the wise Do not buy a Ford made in Dearborn And carefully inspect the vehicle in full sunlight before you do Look it over and over again
0,OK like most of us in my age group 40 50 the name Buick is not a vehicle we are familiar with unless its a Buick Grand National an 80s muscle car At least thats the case for me OK my parents have owned them but I thought it was an old persons carlol but I guess all things change and after having a family myself I have become less about speed and performance and more at whats practical and comfortable Dont get me wrong for a V6 putting out an impressive 291 hp and 277 lbft of torque its no slouch after looking at the Envoys I was sold on the Rainier The Buick Rainier out classes the Envoy and rides like an upper class town car Its the best bang for your buck
1,After being a die hard Chevy guy for so long I had a hard time looking at the F150 but am very happy I did I got the XLT and optioned for the 18 inch wheels and 54 L engine Also got the skid plates chrome package CPT chairs and some other goodies This truck looks so much better then the Chevy and price for value kills the other big trucks I have read the power and gas mileage complaints It tows great and it is a 4x4 so I dont plan on racing anyone As for mileage its a big truck with a V8like my trucks before I did not expect 2530 MPG I am getting around 16 in town and can nurse 20 or so on highway with the cruise set at 80 Very comfortable stylish and roomy
0,My husband and I love this car The ride is incredibly smooth and the comfort is beyond those in the same price range There is plenty of room for a family
1,In the four months I have owned the vehicle 34 days were spent with it in the shop They are continuously replacing the air bags as the panels keep warping 3 on drivers side 2 on passenger side The steering wheel was replaced as well as the exterior temperature sensor The four wheel drive went out after about 5 minutes of using it Gas mileage keeps getting worse and worse down to 106 mpg and to wrap up the experience it has already had to be repainted as ford missed some spots and it started to peel Not what I would expect for  dollar38000 Would never buy a Ford truck again
0,The interior is very nice and the seating is comfortable It is a very quiet ride as well There is a lot of power with the 42L V6 I would definitely recommend
1,This is my 2nd new F150 in 4 yrs just love this trucks everything from the Power to Design both exterior and interior Even though its just a 4x2 has great traction off roading and recently just made one of my 2 annual trips to Mexico and of course it did great on the Mexican Highways cruising at 95 mph non stop it got about 17 mpg not to bad What only bothers me and have been told by my selling dealer that the clunking noise that it makes when holding down the brakes and steering is normal even though I dont think it is normal did not have that problem 03 F150
0,A real truck with real towing capacity yet as quiet and smooth as most luxury cars in town and on trips Optional sound system is very good The nav system in my 2004 was cumbersome so we left it off the new 2007 Buick fixed the AWD system and it engages smoothly in 2007 Competent handling for a luxury truck Dont drive or evaluate it as a sports sedan I used to make jokes about people who drive Buicks but this vehicle grows on you
1,I have a 2007 ford f150 Stx 46L At idle it shakes so bad I had to put a pillow behind my back Several times it even stalled Ford said all these trucks do this It is a natural characteristic of the truck to run rough I say it is time to recall and fix the design flaw these trucks have
0,I think this is a very underrated SUV It is so much nicer than the Envoy which is more popular Very quiet and the fuel economy is about like everything else
1,Just purchased my 2nd F150 Told myself I wasnt going to buy another Ford truck againI was tricked by the interior and exterior design and style of the truck far superior to any of the others My problem is with the way the truck shifts The 4 speed auto feels lazy and sluggish when shifting Also the rear end clunks when the tranny downshifts when accelerating from a lower speedsame as my 1999 F150 With the OD off it doesnt make the noise I also can feel the windshield wiper vibrations through the brake and gas pedals Very annoying There is minor idle vibration as well I would not have purchased this truck if I had noticed these issues during my lengthy 10 minute test drive
0,I have owned my 2007 buick Rendezvous for over 2 years and have not had one problem I got an incredible value when i bought the car as the Rendezvous was at the end of its run The styling hadnt changed much in the last few years but we liked the way it looked and the interior was very nice What surprises me is that I consistently get 23 mpg on the highway This is better than i get with my Nissan Murano which is much smaller In local driving i get around 16 which is painful when gas is  dollar4 a gallon but reasonable when you consider the size and 7 passenger capacity I have 31000 miles and am still going strong
1,Nice truck but dealer told me I made a mistake buying 54 motor Rough idle and vibration at approx 1750 rpm is normal for this truck according to my Ford Dealer Hard to sit at a light and feel the seat vibrating due to the normally running 54 l motor at idle Traded a great running chevrolet at 127000 miles that idled smoother If Ford cannot resolve this non existent according to the dealer problemI will take a bath and go back to a chevroletnever to buy a ford again
0,I had a 2005 rendezvous Pretty much the same but much better gas mileage than the 07With all the incentives offered how could you not buy one from  dollar31000 to  dollar20000 out the door It is a Buick comfortable ride much beter quality than anything else out there for the money Its to bad they opted to drop it in 2007 and rather than keep it and improve it they come out with the enclave a nice ride but out of my price range looking at the 2010 equinox 32 mpg i might have to trade the rendezvous in
1,The 07 Ford F150 is a very well built truck This is my 3rd Ford truck My first one came out of the oil fields and it took a lot of abuse It had 167000 on it when I was done with it and was still running strong I can tell you the 07 is built a lot better than that truck So I have high expectations for it This truck is not going to win any quarter miles but it will pull which is what you want in a truck It is a heavy brute with the comfort of a luxury vehicle I read the reviews on the 07 before I bought it Some complained about acceleration I did not think it was bad at all from taking off It could use a little more at higher speeds but trust me the rest of the truck will out weigh this If you want to race buy the Mustang Low end torque trumps
0,Very nice ride I bought the 07 CX with the luxury package with 27000 miles for  dollar13900 Ive put on 1000 miles since I bought it I think I got a great deal Very smooth ride I have to be careful on the highway because I dont notice when Im speeding My husband is 61 and has plenty of head room
1,Bought the vehicle on 22 May 07 with 81 miles on the odometer Left for Wash DC on the 26th to attend the event at Rolling Thunder memorial Disappointed with the fuel economy and the black soot at the exhaust pipe Vehicle drives well but is underpowered on some of the taller hills on Interstate 40 Thinking the pickup is too heavy for a V6 engine
0,After 24k milesone of the best cars we have owned We had 2 good Chrysler vans This CXL replaced a noisy cheapo gasguzzler Honda Odyssey XL no luxury features even available Liked a rented Rendezvous on Florida vacation Later compared it to the Lexus SUV cramped and boring The Buick is larger inside and  dollar20K cheaper Quiet luxurious versatile and 225 mpg thrifty Comforts of the car are on par with our Avalon sedan 7 people can ride if needed   and with the middle seats out we carry 3 dogs and luggage for trips It has been great in the snow even in our hilly neighborhood Love the car Sad that GM made the dumb decision to discontinue   and replace it with a bulbous gas guzzler
1,Ive heard some ridiculous commercials from Toyota and Nissan claiming the F150 cant tow a trailer  hogwash This is my 3rd F150 No complaints ever Ive driven the Chevy Titan Tundra and the Ram and only the Chevy comes close to the F150 If you want a truck to do what you need with a great ride stick to Ford and Chevy
0,After driving a friends Lexus SUV I was not expecting much from this Buick Surprise We like it much better Sure the dashboard is plain but we improved it by adding a wood grain kit After 27000 miles our only real issue has been the radio which is junk Three visits to the dealer have failed to have any effect Gas mileage is incredibly poor for such a small V6 We only get about 15mpg in town and 22 on the road Our Impala with a similar engine gets at least 5mpg better But the Buick tows our small boat effortlessly there is room galore with the seats folded and so far it has been mechanically reliable The 100000 mile warranty inspires confidence
1,The 2007 Ford SuperCrew I purchased has already had problems The signal lights stopped working last month and the windshield washer stopped working this month There is also a heat sheild that has been fixed twice that is still fibrating in my ear Over all the quality of the truck is poor It is a nice truck to drive when it is working correctly but it has not worked correctly in since it was new I would like to trade it in but Ford plays with the pricing so much that it is hard to find what the real value is They do not hold any value I will take a  dollar12000 dollar15000 loss on it
0,Given that 2007 is the last year for this model good offlease and used examples can be a bargain We purchased ours for  dollar10000 under original list price While not a Lexus by any means it is still half the price for similar comfort and capacity Great warranty coverage Our only real complaint is that the 35 engine could have been the 36 with better power and mileage Also the radio stinks An aftermarket radio is in our future
1,First new truck after driving only cars for 30 years Truck sold itself after renting one from Hertz on a 1 week trip Personally I think its the best looking truck in the market Rugged yet classy Not in your face like Dodge Not bland like GM Not Japanese looking like Nissan or Toyota After 30 years of cars I was pleasantly surprised by ride quality interior design sound isolation Great highway cruiser 4x4 lets me go in deep snow even with regular tires
0,Bought it new now has 10000 miles on it Trouble free Lots of cargo room with 3rd row folded way more than any other crossover approaching minivan versatility The car is very quiet and comfortable
1,Now that I own the 54 liter FLEX FUEL VEHICLE F150 4x4 I am realizing a very poor gasoline fuel economy of about 10 MPG highway which is much less than the 18 MPG that was posted on the window sticker E85 is much worse The nonadjustable seat bottom revealed itself as a rear end problem after the first 200 miles I am not sure what the engineers at Ford were thinking when an adjustable seat bottom was not added to the lower lines of pickups I would have been happy with even a manual adjustment I dont think that these problems are going to disappear as my wallet gets much thinner
0,I fell in love with the style of the SUV I went from a Vue to a Rendezvous much much more roomier Only problems are every time it rains the water was running in through the dashboard Got the driver side fixed but have been back twice for the passenger side Also battery light keeps coming on Waiting to get that fixed Passenger window cracked factory defect waiting for that part and the ceiling panel was hanging got that fixed Still love the car but they should have made the driver seat more adjustable to move back further Lots of room and comfy back seat that reclines Would buy again but maybe have less of a water problem
1,Z plan buyer owned 15 Fords Best luxury truck in classbut Ford is so close to perfect but misses the mark on basic no brainer features and poor warranty Im convinced the engineers do not drive trucks and do models and CAD design for looks not function Unfortunately they could have a home run and turn around the company if they would listened to the public and get back to basics Weak AC and pitiful fuel economy Front passengers have elbows in rear cupholders Poor location Most Ford dealerships try to scam general public and still try to con the A X and Z plan buyers with overinflated dealer adds further ruining Ford experience
0,We purchased a loaded CX in February and now have about 3000 miles on it My wife and I are very happy with the vehicle It has a smooth and relatively quite ride and is enjoyable to drive The vehicle has more than adequate acceleration for most situations We seem to get about 19 to 20 mpg overall My wife really liked the looks of the Nissan Murano but with a  dollar1300 discount off the list price  dollar5200 in rebates and  dollar3300 of GM card credit the bang for the buck we got with the Rendezvous was light years ahead of the Murano We couldnt be happier
1,The 1st year of ownership was great since then we have had the rear brakes recalled because of abnormal wear   and grinding under 15000 miles Power Steering pump went bad AC Compressor went bad power windows quit working then magically fixed themselves when I put it in gear it lunges forward if the AC is running If my foot is not firmly on the brakes it lunges hard enough to hit something in front or behind the vehicle And the OEM tires lasted about 35000 miles with regular rotations It is very comfortable   and gets decent fuel mileage in town   and exceptional highway mileage for a car of its size The shifting of automatic transmission take a little getting used to
0,We were looking to replace one of our SUVs with a vehicle that provided better gas mileage without sacrificing cargo capacity My wife did not want a minivan or a car as a replacement She enjoys the driving position that an SUV provides Like most buyers we initially looked at the offerings from the imports Friends of ours went through the same process about a year ago and ended up buying a 2006 Rendezvous Both he and his wife highly recommended it After test driving a 2007 Rendezvous we became a believer With the current rebate we ended up buying a fully loaded CXL for the price of a stripped down import If ride roominess and mileage are important consider the Rendezvous
1,Its great that reviews like Edmunds knock vehicles that are actually superb examples of engineering and excellent designfunctionality It keeps the prices low I purchased my 500 AWD Limited not long ago used with 19000 miles I was looking for a suitable substitute to the mundane and boring SUVs and a departure from the bumpy ride from my most recent leased vehicle a Dakota 4x4 The 500 is a complete 180 in terms of quality comfort utility and style The interior is totally functional the visibility is unrestricted and the power from the 30 engine is more than adequate for anything beyond a street race at  dollar200 a gal for gas what the heck is so important about speed
0,I like it It is a shame that Buick would take a SUV within middle class range up Hey GM Buick help us middle class out We love the SUV The Enclave is out of my league
1,I am an insurance adjuster and this is my company car and I drive it hard I currently have about 67000 miles on it and have had numerous problems with it mechanically At 30K the trans began shifting hard took it to the dealer and had the throttlebody replaced At 50K the steering was loose and was pulling hard had the left lower ball joint which only came with the control arm and the steering gear replaced At 65K the same trans problem and they again replaced the throttlebody Another adjuster has had similar problems with the steeringsuspension Also 30 is not that powerful You might have better luck as an everyday commuter instead of a workhorse like me
0,Why did I not notice this vehicle for so many years When it came time to replace the mini van I was looking for something different but something that still had a 3rd row and a reasonable price By chance I found out the Rendezvous did Took it for a test drive and fell in love I found it to be comfortable very roomy and fun to drive A quick check on other reviews and consumer reports gave high marks The rebate was great Purchased it a week later Very satisfied
1,We are a family of 4 two are still in car seats Lots of room inside you dont have to worry about kids kicking the back of your seat The trunk is awesome lots of room for everything Just wished the mileage was a little better We struggle to get 30 hwy
0,I wanted something a little larger than the RAV4 and CRV but still easy to manuever into tight parking spaces In addition to the extra room the smooth and quiet ride sold me on the Rendezvous The V6 engine has enough power for almost every situation This midsize SUV feels nimble driving in the city but is very stable and comfortable on the highway Body lean during cornering is well controlled The standard rear backup sensors are very helpful With the 3rd row folding seat optional on the CX the ability to hold an occasional 7 people is a nice feature Since Buick stopped advertising the Rendezvous some time ago you should be able to get one at a great price like I did
1,I have had this car about a month and starting to really like it I was surprised that the drivers seat raises up high enough for me I have had SUVs the last couple of times and at first was concerned that a car would be too low I love the sides and back but the front of Fords vehicles arent that sharp Inside is great  lots of extras Only negative is power I did not get AWD so I have the regular transmission I previously had the CVT in a Freestyle and got used to the smooth shift The Five struggles with the ac on and I have to remember not to pull out in front of anyone I mean 206 hp for a 3700 lb vehicle is ridiculous
0,Fun to drive and relaxing too My wife loves being up above the traffic so she can see well in her trip to work and for her many trips on the Garden State Parkway We did not want a 3rd seat and its great that Buick offers that option It gives us more storage room Love having dials and switches that we can actually read vs a symbol I own a LaSabre and really like Buicks quality I am very very dissapointed that they are discontiuing this car I think they should have advertised this more Oh well we are very happy to own the Rendezvous and think others would also
1,I have had my 500 a little over a year and had very little problems with it It is a great road car and the easiest car I have ever had to get into and out of Just an outstanding car
0,Great looking Great driving Many features that no other SUV offers for the price Looking forward towards many years of driving pleasure
1,All in all very little to complain about after 5000 miles Factory CD failed on first use but replaced Very comfortable to be in although larger drivers may find their right leg too close to the center console Complaints by critics about stylingpower have proven unwarranted People like the look of the car and havent found acceleration lacking with CVTengine pairing Handling is OK not great but ride is better than that It is not silent at highway speeds but not really a problem Plenty of interior storage huge trunk elevated seating position its mostly all good
0,This is one of the best handling cars that I have ever owned The Rendezvous CXL is very comfortable when driving in town or out on the highway Huge amount gadgets for the price
1,I just got this car for our company for the traveling salesman Over the weekend it was not being used and my car was getting fixed so I borrowed it Although its not as fast as my other cars it still has power for accelerating but passing at high speeds is difficult for it The interior in huge The seats are big and comfortable I was really suprised at how good this car was after hearing so many terrible things about Ford and being a GM guy this is hard to admit The Ford really is a good daily car Not for an enthusiast but it gets the job done
0,Just bought an 07 Rendezvous about 6 months ago and I love it Great for hauling the family A little slow but extremely comfortable and functional Great vehicle GM
1,Consumer reports hit the nail on the head This big car drives well gets good mileage and has lots of room Add to that the fact you can get big discounts and rebates with a 5 year 60K warranty and its a nobrainer if you are in the market for a big American car that drives like an import and looks like it wont age much
0,We purchased the Rendezvous and absolutely love the vehicle The riding comfort is unbelievable The performance thus far has been great
1,Bought the car as a family sedan We have been delighted with its comfort performance build quality and safety The 30 while not a screamer so to speak does provide enough oompf to get motoring on the surrounding super highways Have nearly 10K miles and not experienced any problems to date The only down side is we expected the fuel economy to be a little better but being a car of this size its not really that disappointing Overall we would buy it again
0,I am an owner of a BMW M5 and an Audi S4 But I needed a vehicle with genuine luggage capacity for a vacation I rented a Rendezvous CXL I really liked it My wife really liked it Even our collegebound son admitted he liked itThe Rendezvous offered very comfortable seats and comfortable ride quiet and reasonable horsepower though I always would like more It provides a great view and command of the highway and there was no difficulty in handling city driving I had been considering the purchase of a BMW X5 as an SUV but I am now seriously considering a Rendezvous CXL or Buicks successor to the Rendezvous the Enclave Congratulations to a fine American car
1,The 500 is the only sedan I could get into with a huge trunk and interior for less than  dollar25K loaded up The styling is generic but not offending The 30 liter engine has good highway passing power and far from being underpowered The ride and handling are ok but steering could be a little firmer and more direct Shame on Ford for removing the door protection moldings I will have to see if the dealer can install them aftermarket
0,Buick is a step ahead of other competitors even with GM I got the CX with all the options available on it I like the CX because the exterior mirrors are shiny black The CXL uses body color I leased this car and was very surprised It is a luxury SUV with an msrp of  dollar30000 I leased it for under  dollar400 sign and drive I have never driven a car that is so refined and drives so smoothly Another thing going for it is the standard rear park assist It really helps avoid accidents Most luxury cars like Benz dont even offer it standard I cant live without OnStar anymore I always forget my cell but I dont need to worry anymore Leaving my keys in car is a problem too but no worries anymore It has features that only the Americans can think of like comfort level and huge compartments The second row has 2 center pieces that fold away That means that this car is really wide It is going to last a long time will buy again
1,Took on a trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and couldnt ask for a better ride About a 1200 mile round trip getting almost 29 miles per gallon Had no trouble passing or getting up the grades on cruise control I would definitely buy another Ford product
0,This is one of the best handling cars that I have ever owned The Rendezvous CXL is very comfortable when driving in town or out on the highway The headsup display keeps your eyes on the road and not looking down to set your cruise The instrument panel is laid out to see your gauges but are also shown in the headsup display My wife drove a Buick LaCrosse but to her the Rendezvous gives her a comfortable ride and the ease of driving a small car in traffic but doesnt feel like a full size SUV Its very nicely equipped and for the money its a good car to own I read some of the reviews on the 2005   and 2006 Rendezvous I feel like a lot of the complaints have been fixed on the 2007 model
1,At this point the only thing that I would change is a little larger engine It strains some times
0,I love this truck so much I look for things to buy just to go out and drive it My daughter loves it and so does everyone I know I think that they will all go out and get one soon I will definitely get another one when the lease is up I hope they still make more Love it to bits
1,Pretty reliable  no issues in 36k Has good pep handles quite well is well laid out inside is roomy Base seats are awful gas mileage is soso and somewhat noisy inside but Ill take that as a trade off for a lighter more nimble car that does not need 200 hp to move
0,We have owned a Jimmy and 2 Bravadas and the Buick Rendezvous is by far the best SUV we have ever driven The heads up display should be an industry standard This is an excellent vehicle
1,3 months 4500 miles so far Mileage is 32 highway with cruise control at 75 mph 26 around town Far better than my old Ranger but less than EPA unrealistic estimates No mechanical troubles or noises Plenty of room in rear seat for most people Handles very well around corners much better than anything else Ive owned Pirelli P6 tires are quiet but track pavement grooves Acceleration is good for this size car low end torque is also good Go through the gears and be in 5th by 40 mph Brakes good I have the safety package with side seat airbags havent been able to find seat covers that dont interfere with airbags Sun visors are wimpy and look too cheap Overall very pleased
0,Im very happy with the truck I wish it had front sensors too The drivers mirrors on the outside of the truck are a great size Im really able to see whats coming up on me I love the OnStar in it I would love to get another one when my time is up I would definitely recommend this car to anyone plus I already get a lot of compliments on it now
1,The little ZX3 is not a Mazda 3 but it is its less expensive cousin with the almost same 20 engine less the vvt Too bad that Ford is replacing the hatch back in 08 with a coupe but maybe it will drive just as well I am getting 25 mpg in town and on a trip across California and Arizona on the interstate I got 30 mpg average on a 400 mile trip and my ZX is an automatic I have only had it for a few months but they have been trouble free and Ford now has a 5 year 60K warranty just in case Its a solid little car for the price
0,This is my wifes car She says it drives like a luxury car Its very good on the highway and we drove it from Friendswood Texas to Chatham Ont Handling and acceleration is good Its comfortable and no blind spots looking out the back We have 2nd row buckets seats You need to drive it we average 415 miles per tank of gas You need to drive it
1,We have not had this car for but a few days but it is the neatest and best equipped car you can get for the money We have a black SE sedan with the auto trans tilttelescoping wheel speed control and the sport group which includes the Trated tires and multispoke alloy wheels and fog lamps tach and leather wrapped steering wheel The antitheft as standard is a delight The car has the 50state emissions 20L but the power is right where you need it on our twolane hilly roads It is a really nice handling and power combination for the 5575 mph range We stepped up from a Contour weve had two It is a step up in every way and not much smaller of a car
0,Great car very comfortable on trips A lot of space and nice design
1,As far as driving goes its kinda spunky Im getting over my loss on a nice 95 Mustang GT But this little car has surprised me Its a base model 5speed So far the only thing Im complaining about is a slight engine tappingknocking Which Im still yet to get checked out But overall she looks very promising for future modifications
0,This vehicle handles great and has great comfort features The third row seat is really nice because it folds down flat This vehicle has the feel of a luxury vehicle yet the look of a small SUV This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned and would definitely recommend it to others
1,I bought this car because it was all I could get financed for It is fun to drive and not too hard on the eyes The advertised gas mileage is complete horse puckey but I still average about 24 mpg On long road trips I get about 31 The rear shocks squeak loudly and the upgraded stereo sounds horrible But all in all it handles like a little race car and the get up and go is nice
0,Great car excellent accelleration one of the smoothest cars Ive ever drivenSmooth ride and stylingtypical of a Cadillac Color is Thunder Gray a 36 liter v6 with a chrome wire mesh grill Wife also loves the and nimble response and the tight steering We should have bought this car a long time ago
1,I leased this car because I was tired of using my Toyota Solara as a truck and I needed a vehicle for my many trips to Home Depot and did not feel the need for an SUV I wanted something smaller that would serve my purposes This Focus Hatchback has exceeded my expectations It is fun to drive and the 4 cylinder Mazda engine is extremely quiet and it will haul you away from a stop that will leave other drivers wondering whats under the hood Ive carried a 6000 watt generator 13x13 rolled rug ladders power tools and more shrubs fertilizer and potting soil than I can count The cargo area just swallows cargo
0,I love my CTS Sport it has the 18 Wheel performance and appearance package handles very well for the size Not quite as well as my previous Audi and Porsche but very nice for a larger car Love the shiftable automatic Only issue was a broken rear sway bar replaced by the warranty Cadillac has an excellent Certified Pre owned program 6 years100000 miles
1,I traded a 2002 PT Cruiser with 73000 miles for this car after having starting problems with the Cruiser and the locking device going haywirelocking and unlocking by itself So far I really enjoy this Ford Focus more than I did the Cruiser Granted I miss the retro look But the Focus has a great European style design It kind of reminds me of some Volvos I have seen around town It brakes extremely well and has a quick take off for a 4 cylinder It gets better gas mileage than the Cruiser I had Also it handles much better than a 2000 Neon that I also owned previously I can feel weight to the car as I drive it and I like that It corners well and I dont feel excessive leaning
0,Fun to drive rides great drives great handles great tight in rear seat behind tall driver tough to get in and out of deep door cills Fit and finish is good Very little maintenance issues
1,My 93 Escort GT was on its last legs due to an accident It would have made it a couple more years without a doubt Alas it was not meant to be Thus a search for a suitable replacement began Toyota Yaris Honda Fit Chevy Aveo etc Final solution Focus ZX4 SE with almost every option except cold weather package and 16 wheels X plan and  dollar250000 rebate plus a little trade in equaled about  dollar14k A similarly equipped Honda Civic  well over  dollar20k Nobrainer
0,I havent had a very good experience with my CTS I have had major repairs and the car is only 1 yr and 5 months I love the look of the car and the features But would like to try another CTS because I think I ended up with a defective model
1,I like the stick shift The transmission is smooth and aids with fuel economy The heater and AC are great and easy to control The rear seats are a little cramped for big people but I rarely have anyone in the rear Ill buy another Focus when this one has a lot more miles on it
0,Ive had this car for about six months now and I love it even more than I did on day one Its my second car in the entry luxury market with my first being the 98 328i I know how much I really love this car because all I want to do is dress her up and take her out on the town My only complaints are related to comfort and interior design After about one hour in this car I want stop and fix the pain in my back no matter how I adjust the seats Our 2002 Camry XLE seating and interior features are superior to the Cadillac which is a shame Well never use this car for road trips This car was a poor choice with two young kids in the back seat In so many ways it reminds me of the 328
1,My husband and I got this car less than two years ago brand new We only use it for commuting to work so it has low mileage It doesnt get the posted fuel economy 6 months ago it started shuddering at stops They told us it was a transmission leak and supposedly fixed it Two weeks ago it began dying at stops so they replaced a tranny gasket Now only two weeks later its shuddering dying and has a fast leak of transmission fluid puddling everywhere We can smell it as we drive too Ford is putting a bandaid on a big hidden problem and were thinking of trading this lemon in before the warranty is out and were stuck replacing a transmission out of pocket
0,My family has a long story with Cadillacs I remember the 1st Seville and I remmeber how much I loved it Now Im in love all over again This car is fast agile and a huge improvement over the Caddies of the past Its so good to see thant GM has finally seen the light My only regret I should have waited couple months for the 08 but what the heck Im in love
1,I like this car I bought it used with 17k on it Im 62 and its cramped inside a little This is definitely a little person car There a no power amenities Reminds me of my old Ford Escort It seems like the same size but I put on weight about 50 lbs so this car is gonna make me skinny again Overall a steal for under 15 thou Good gas milage handles well But they need to do a factory recall on the gas cap Almost every review I read about this car complaims about the smell of gas I had to take mine back to the dealer and he tightened it up and reset the codes
0,Quality and and reliability are above expectations No problems to report to date with heavy freeway miles
1,This is my second Focus At 40K miles the stock 6 CD player started draining the battery causing me to need jumps as long as the main fuse allowed power to the radioCd I spoke with Ford  not covered Nearly new car dying nightly now working again only because I pulled the fuse Ford is aware of the issue but wont work it This has soured me on Ford and the Focus and I wont be buying another FMC product
0,Great car shows Cadillac understands how to put together great product Exclellent styling edgy unique and attractive On a cost basis performance exceeds competitors and seems a better value Love the evolution to the 08 as well Cannot wait to see the new CTS in Thunder Gray with in a coupe next year maybe GM will do rumored convertible If so I may have to trade mine in on a new one
1,we leased a 2007 ford focus and returned it 2 weeks ago to purchase a 2009tord fusion To our shock we recd a bill from FMC stating we owe dollar60000 for overuse of the perille tires We have always leased and never have we recd a bill for anythingcalled other ford motor dealers and they stated the perille tires are only warranted for 1 yrwhy is FMC putting tires on cars that they know in advance will not hold upwe turned the car inw31000 miles perille tire is suppose to be good for 40000 miles FMC is really shooting themselves in the foot because if we are forced to pay this it will be the last ford we ever buy what an insult to the consumer tires were noisy   and poor traction
0,This car hugs the road like its on rails Amazing performance for a luxury car Good power firm yet comfortable ride Superb Bose radio XM and OnStar Refined interior sleek exterior
1,i have had this car almost two years and have had nothing but problems with it Within 5 months new brakes and rotors Dash panel lights have gone out three times Now battery and alternator problems Not only that in the last year I have had to replace the tires and rims And they need to be done again I will never own a Focus again Not good for car seats or tall people
0,having a car like this was for me the greatest experience ever as the car gave me that sense of control which you normally dont get from other vehiclesfor me its a dream coming true
1,Good car overall interior is roomy but cup holders far away and cups tip over Have always felt the car pulled to the right Im a women so the excuse I get its just the road Steering is stiff to me Pirelli tires not good only 21000 miles and already need replaced Ford states tires have even wear but baldness not their problem
0,This is my second Cadillac My first was a 1986 Eldorado which was pure junk But Cadillac has hit a homerun with the CTS I also own a Corvette and the CTS is the 4dr version This car came equipped with the luxury and sport packages The styling is bold and is recongnizable a mile away Performance and handling equal the German and Japanese rivals Its also equipped with OnStar XM and a great navigation system You need patience to program everything but once done it all works well together Thanks GM
1,This is my second ZX3 My first 07 was totaled in March Both of these cars arewere 5 speed S models The only option on both was AC I have gotten 39 to 40 mpg on both these cars without running the air With the AC on I get 34 to 35 This car is a lot of fun to drive and the only negative comment would be the road noise its not a problem on good roads Maybe Ford will make another hatchback soon The second one had Goodyears the first Hankook tires The Goodyears are not as quiet but they are holding up well at 17500 miles This is a great car for the money I can recommend it highly
0,Just got the CTS last week Got a 2fer Luxury sedan and sports car Great power and cornering ability in a trim body with very comfortable seats and a good ride Cant wait to take it on a road trip this weekend
1,Best mileage so far is 365 MPG Five speed manual shifts easily On open road car interior is very noisey road noise and is the only downside Fit and finish was ok since hatch was not aligned very well from factory Placement of the aux power receptacle is questionable since located very high on the dash I use the car for basic commute averaging 75 miles per day Unfortunate that Ford decided to discontinue the hatch Smaller engine 15 liter and taller gears 2 thru 6 instead of 1 thru 5 would have made great mileage candidate Advertised split rear seat refers to seat back only and not seat bottom so not truely a split seat configuration
0,Driving is fun and car handles well Like the Cadillac experience in terms of service  tops
1,We bought a 2007 Ford Focus S base model in Nov no pw or locks just a plain jane get to work car With only 6400 Miles on it the headlights have dimmed a lot dash lights dimmed battery light comes on Replaced battery after getting stuck on the side of interstate and still have the same problem Its sad when you have to have your vehicle serviced at only 6400 Miles for powertrain prolems Do not buy this car unless you go and get a 2008 model that is showing to have better build quality But on the other hand if you dont have a lead foot it has great mpg
0,This is my first caddy I love this car I test drove a BMW and a then I drove this car I would buy this over any BMW I drove over 12 different makes and models and then I bought my caddy
1,Purchased new as around town car specifically for good gas mileage Havent gotten it Averaging about 23 mpg combined and under 30 on highway only driver and one passenger only Interior is cramped for older people difficult to enterexit as door sills are quite high Front seat legroom is very limited tho seemed OK during the test drive Front storageconveniences quite limited any beverage in cup holders is prone to spilltip as driver and passenger legs have no where else to go Wipers are quiet Radio is good Steeringhandling is goodfun Sporty handling Very poor gas mileage Recommend against this car for anyone 510 or more or over 200 lbs or anyone buying for mpg
0,I am very impressed with the performance and quality of the CTS I had been driving BMWs for the past six years but wanted to Buy American this time and Cadillac was the way to go I have the Luxury and 17inch Sport Packages The ride and seat comfort far exceed the BMW with only a small sacrifice in handling It has great acceleration from the 36L engine with an automatic transmission It also has outstanding maneuverability thanks to a supertight turning circle
1,Before my Focus I drove a 93 Escort This Focus with the 5speed manual is a much better car I dont really have any gripes about the car Gas mileage is good and the car is very peppy and handles great Love the sound system I got the 6 disc changer MP3 stereo Sharp looking car in black
0,This is actually my wifes car but Ill tell you we test drove everything If you want to fit in and not have your car have a personality go buy the Lexus or Acura This car offers more room than anything in its class The others we tested were fine but the CTS has its own personality and was the best overall ride and drive for us We tested the 328 G35 IS 350 TL S40 C and EClass Check this car out for its overall drive It is a great choice
1,Bad stuff first At 500 miles major oil leak from defective rivet in engine block Dealer repaired good so far Front tires out of balance from day of delivery Creaking and groaning noises from rear axle shock area Dealer cant find the problem Gas mileage is 22mpg city and 27mpg highway Only 3000 miles so far Paid 13300 has side airbag pkg Paid extra for extended warranty and premium maintanance plans Gas mileage is 22 23city and 27 highway Not good
0,For the price there are other cars out there that are better equipped Locking wheel nuts lumbar support theft alarm and rear AC vents are only available as hefty options My 96 Taurus and 02 Tribute even came stock with most that I mentioned Yes in other respects this is a fun car to drive It has plenty of pep gets decent MPG handles very well and has comfortable seating for the most part Based on this purchase experience firsttime Caddy buyer it will be my last Reason There is more bang for the buck with the competition
1,The 07 Focus is a good little car It has all the features that you need to have a comfortable ride except for space If youre a bigger person Im 64 the leg room up front can be a little cramped
0,The 28 engine is definitely underpowered The car rides very well and I feel very comfortable in it The company and dealership come highly recommended
1,I was looking for a 2nd car to replace my much beloved butsick gas sucking 1997 Suburban This being just a second car I didnt want to spend a lot but I also didnt want something boring to drive and also I didnt want to spend a lot Well I couldnt pass up the rebates end of model incentives and the price Over all this car is fairly nice Im not real crazy about the perelli P6 tires and the gas mileage is a little less than expected and a 6 sp manual option would have been nice
0,I have this car for two weeks now and I am very satisfied with it I hate when some people write a review on a car without ever owning it Thats just plain hot air If you are looking for Detroit quality this is the one Mine is loaded with all available options including DVD navigation Two major options are the 17 wheel sport package which by the way is the only wheel package that you can get with the navigation system and the 36 luxury package I was luck enough to find the car in stock at a dealer in New Jersey Apparently not too many are ordered like this one in white diamond with all the bells and whistles I literally bought this car over the phone Not to bad for Detroit Iron
1,I purchased the car about 7 months ago and have already put 10K miles on it I have not had one single issue with it I had the dealer put some low pros on it with 17 rims which make the already well handling car better in handling Its probably the best handling car Ive owned even better than the Honda I used to have Ive never owned a Ford before but Im definitely impressed with this car and will buy another Ford I get a lot of compliments on how the car looks and it has the feel of being mechanically sturdy
0,Besides test driving the CTS I test drove a Toyota Camry Toyota Avalon Acura TL Infiniti G35 and a Mini Cooper The Mini Cooper won hands down but I have a wife and two kidsso the Mini didnt win The CTS won So why did it win There was more room in the backseat than in its competitorswhich the kids need I love the exterior of the CTS I was able to get a 6speed manual with the CTS The seats were greatthey hugged the body The interior was not as nice as the TL or the G35 but I just enjoyed the ride of the CTS more than any other car besides the Mini I got the CTS sport w 18 wheelsI would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a new car
1,I love this car Had it coming up on 2 years and havent had one ioda of a problem with it Never been serviced Helps dad owns on muffler shop or had it back at the dealership I was really skeptical buying this as I wasnt impressed with Focuss of the past besides the SVT So when I was told this was the car that discountinued the SVT I had to test it out I walked out 2 hours later a proud owner The interior is a little bland and my leg rubs against the center console besides that I fit in there like a glove and I am 61 280 So not small Also this car goes I have done a couple small things and doing about 175hp and doing 141 in 14 I love the looks on other peoples faces 
0,The Cadillac CTS has very good quality Cadillac has done it right with this vehicle from the styling to performance The ride is very comfortable and there is easy access to all of the technology I have had no problems what so ever with this vehicle would reccomend it to all
1,I find the Focus wagon to be just about the right size for all my needs It can carry 5 passengers though the back seat might be a little cramped for large people With the back seat folded down it can carry a surprisely big load It handles nicely in all traffic situations It has plenty of getup and go Merging into expressway traffic is no problem at all At highway speeds I tend to have a heavy foot I average about 32mpg
0,I used to own a Mercedes and let me tell you is fantastic The Cadillac CTS looks performance build quality and comfort are all superior to the MercedesBenz CClass
1,Having just traded in a VW Jetta for a Ford Focus I have gone from flashy to bland Thats not a bad thing The Focus gets much better gas mileage It simply lacks the interior quality   and design of the Jetta The Focus handling is very good The noise level is superb There is none If one is looking for a commuter car that offers great mileage  the Focus is a great choice
0,I used to buy Nissans and Hondas for all these years I am very happy with the decision that I made to buy a Cadillac CTS It is just excellent
1,A surprising car The 20 is significantly faster than my beloved 2003 Protege ES The ride is nice and soft yet the car handles really well There is a lot of body roll during spirited driving but this isnt a performance model Big truck easily fits a lawn mower Soft seats decent dead pedal placement high seating position If you dont care about looks this is the best American car Better than Neon and Cobalt Now the bad This is an ugly little car It looks like something poor people would drive in the former Soviet Union Also the interior is cheap and ugly and after a while the plastic starts to smell The engine sounds really weak and the transmission shifts oddly at times
0,This is by far the nicest car Ive ever owned Its stylish sporty has a great paint job white diamond beautiful leather and wood grain interior handles like a charm I will buy Cadillacs forever
1,Smaller on the outside yet bigger on the inside compared to other cars in this category both domestic and foreign With a few options this car gave me all I needed at a very low price I like the fact that a low mileage lease was offered
0,This car handles and rides very well It accelerates quickly and has the power to maneuver yet its easy on the gasoline We do a 5050 mix of cityhwy and get about 25 mpg average The interior is not plush but is solid There is good leg and head room for tall front seat passengers
1,After owning a 94 Escort which still runs that had a bunch of little problems around 80k I swore I would never buy another compact Ford So I tested the competition only the Mazda 3 left me inspired but with all the rebates Ford had going the 3 would have been at least about 4k more My frugal side just couldnt pass up a nicely loaded new car for under 14k out the door Get the side airbags poor safety rating without them
0,The 2007 CTS 36L Sport is the most fun I have had since I drove Porches 15 years ago I didnt know a sport luxury car could be this much fun The OnStar and XM radio features were unexpected fun and insurance in the case of OnStar Getting into the car and having the seat and mirrors go to my preset postions is a nice feature The car has more than enough power  255hp  I didnt get the CTSV  V8 because of gas mileage
1,I bought the Focus as a daily driver and turned my Sport Trac into a weekend boattoating pleasure driver The Focus has lived up to every expectation in the two weeks Ive owned it I drive over 60 miles each day and not only is the Focus fun to drive but it surpassed all my expectations I didnt think a 20L 4 cylinder could accelerate fast enough or have enough high end torque to hold my own in Orlando traffic but Ive been proven wrong Not only that but for my first full tank of gas I got 35 mpg Not too shabby at all
0,Every time I drive this car I become more impressed with it The style is sharp and distinctive It stands out from the others that all seem to resemble each other The performance acceleration steering control and comfort of the ride are incredible Its fun to drive I bought mine in Infrared which is gorgeous This is the best car I have ever owned
1,So far Im getting about 34 to 35 mpg on standard 5speed It seems wider and is higher than my Escort wagon which I prefer I think it is a good value compared to others on the market For me if its not a Ford its not a car
0,The 2007 Cadillac CTS is a sporty tight well designed vehicle
1,I bought a used 07 Sel FWD In April 09 with 21000 miles I can not find anything I do not like This vehicle has great interior roomand the footprint is the the same as the 98 Taurus wagon with 150K miles on it that I retired It is the easiest car I have ever changed oil on The gas mileage is outstanding 2122 normal everyday driving With 5 adults on the Interstate at 70 mph the computer indicated 28mpg I did not believe that number and did my own calculation and the result was 27The third row seat is fine as long as your not going too far The front and second row seats are great No mechanical problems  but I have not driven that many milesEnough power for me
0,This automobile has all the expected features of a smooth and quiet luxury ride and also has the quickness and power of a sports car It is great to take on the highway for business trips yet it is a comfortable family car for a family of five that includes three teenagers My 16 year old son relishes driving it
1,I am an avid Ford owner but am extremely disappointed to learn that at 54000 miles I am being told that yes they know there is a problem with the transmission CVT and they recognize the risk it poses to citizens but they are not willing to repair at their expense I really dont want another car but cannot justify repairing this one
0,I purchased the 2007 DTS Performance used with 13000 miles It replaced a 2003 CTS WE are very pleased with the handling quietness and comfort of the vehicle The MPG is very positively surprising particularly when the car plenty of power THe memory seats are very handy the controls are simple and well within reach The Bose sound system is very nice Weve traveled quite a bit in this car this year and we arrive much more relaxed than when in traveling in other cards weve had Visibility seems poor when backing the car and the proximity sensors help Very well pleased with this American car
1,I wrote a review a year ago about how great the car was in the winter and on a trip to FloridaIn April 09I still like the car but the rear brakes needed replacing at 28000 miDealer said my car was not in the recall periodMy responseI am not paying for new brakesperiodFord would not cover them even though I had the same problem as othersThe dealer saw my 8 years of having vehicles serviced and paid for themThe infamous Continental tires were done at 34000I replaced with Triple TreadsI am not sure if I will buy another FordI really like my Freestylebut understand why people buy foreign 
0,Fun to drive tighter cabin feelno gas tank release or lock no automatic break release rear trunk area too high no auto trunk closelock Leaves a lot to be desired from the previous years of Cadillac ownership Drivers seat really squeals with the leather rubbing against the console rear headliner problems Navigation is great so is the Bose sound Gas mileage is less than my previous DTS by three miles city and 2 miles highway The higher end shorter body makes it look more like a sport than a luxury sedan The vehicle has enough power but sure sucks up the gas when you step on it Nice color coordination on the Mystic Gray ext and the titanium interior
1,Bought it used with 23k on it My wife   and I have put a little over 1000 on it and we are very pleased The mileage is unbelievable for a vehicle this size Averages about 215mpg around town and on a recent trip got 308mpg running 55 75 with mostly 65mph ranging from 5000ft  65000ft elevation Rides very nice and everyone likes the layout and comfort Visibility is good and I like the 6CD playerFor the  dollar15000 we paid I would feel guilty expecting anything more from it
0,07 DTS Luxury II  which is the 08 luxury III Have owned the performance too Turn on the Peter White cd Open the sunroof and drive to another level of comfort Handles well People are surprised about the Northstar gas mileage which is excellent for a car over two tons Excellent crash test ratings Ive bought new before but this time I went for one that was exactly what I wanted if I had bought new plus certified gives me another 80000 miles and 6 years bumper to bumper  it is one year old and has 20000 miles The beautiful real burled wood is very high gloss Lots of new equipment to play with Love the shiny chrome wheels   andsaved over 25000 buying it a year old
1,My fiancee wanted another Explorer even though she had numerous mechanical problems with her previous Explorer She was talked into buying the Freestyle partly because of the CVT The car is noisy sluggish and cramped The capper The vaunted CVT failed after 50000 miles The price tag  dollar7000 Ford disavows the possibility that it was a defect Have you driven a Ford lately Good Luck brother
0,This is a fantastic vehicle Worlds ahead the previous model Excellent performance   and much quieter at high speeds than the LS460   and superior seats
1,Bought a Freestyle limited June 2007 and almost a year later had to trade it in From day one we had a constant gas smell Took it in and half a tank of gas later could find no problem Kept driving it and smell got worse Mpg highway was around 18 City was 15 at best Winter was terrible because it would get stuck in 12 inch of snow We had the pebble leather and it reflected in the front window very badly
0,Why do reviewers think everything on wheels has to be an McClaren This is a luxury car that is extremely comfortable reasonably nimble for a 2 ton vehicle easy to enter and exit gets me 18 mpg around town well made gives me a back massage decent appearance It does what I want it to do in terrific fashion Im not sure why a luxury automobile needs 55series tires 17 inch wheels and nearly 300 horsepower but it does Ive owned a 800 hp streetlegal 57 Chevy Ive driven my Dads Chrysler Hemi for several thousand milesand they were both great but Ill take my Caddy for everyday driving Its solid American iron and I dont think it needs to apologize for anything
1,We have put almost 15000 miles on our Freestyle in less than a year We just returned from a trip to Florida with 7 passengers 6 adult sized people plus a toddler and luggage Maybe it is because I dont test drive sports cars but the pro reviewers missed the boat on the CVT and power 2527 mpg fully loaded and passing other cars going up the mountains Too bad Ford dropped this powertrain for more horsepower and poorer mileage The only problems I have heard about are the premature tire wear and rear brakes Our tires are ok so far and well see on the brakes I think the writers did a disservice to this car The Freestyle is not flashy but does what it is meant to do
0,Overall quality fit and finish a step up from previous models Driver door lock switch defective caused alarm every time car was opened with key Easily fixed by dealer Very satisfying car to drive Under appreciated value for the money
1,We went from an Excursion to a Freestyle We were aprehensive at first but it is roomy and I dont knock my head getting the seats We have put 7 good sized people in the unit and every on was comfortable we probablt topped the 1125 cargo limit but it showed no adverse signs of handling On vacation we took the Rocky Mountain passes with again a load close to 1k Berthond  Rabbit ears and on the way bak from Oregon and Califonia The Syskius Donner and Vale pass aagain very comfortably  For the passengers there is pleny of knee room fro those in the rear seat has more knee room than Volvo or Passatt and more seating area as well
0,This car combines the best of the European driving characteristics with the best of American luxury features to give the driver and the passenger a fine balance of automotive performance Cadillac has developed a vehicle that will serve the needs of both young and senior drivers
1,Bought it used with 13400 miles on it Have run two fuel tanks through it now in two weeks Great handling for a big car Much better than the 06 Taurus it replaced Comfort handling and space utilization is outstanding 2nd and 3rd row seats dont have any legroom issues Taller people 511 cant use the 3rd row headrests as they hit the headliner first if they lean back No issues with upright seating position Worst issue is that with an 8020 cityhighway mix Im getting about 165 mpg Worse than Id expected Dont think AWD is worth the mileage hit Engine does get a bit noisy above 2500 rpm A friend bought an 07 explorer same weekend He likes mine better
0,We rented one of these babys in Hawaii Trust me this is definitely a car that anyone should show up in to any sort of party or get together Plenty of power sounds like a muscle car when revved lots of get up and go and extremely quiet Handles decently as well for a car 9 ft longer than a Lexus LS 460 It is more the experience of driving one as would be driving something like a Lincoln Town Car more than actually owning it If you need seating for 6 and something old and stylin go for it Way too overpriced though for some of the idiosyncracies is has just pick up a used one
1,Ive had my car since April 07 have gone across country and back driven in the pouring rain I dont worry as much about hydroplanin and love my car Its big enough for my 6415 yr old son my daughter and our 4 dogs So many bells and whistles for a price you cant beat Ford just doesnt know a good thing when they have it
0,This is my first ever Cadillac and have been driving for 40 years It amazes me there are not more DTSs sold The ride comfort and feeling of security makes me wish I had purchased a Cadillac before this
1,I have had the Freestyle only a couple of weeks but I can already see that I made the right choice It drives good in torrential downpours it handles well on very curvy roads it hauls 6 family members ages 581 nicely and goes onward through the fog without any trouble The fuel economy hasnt dropped below 20 mpg in cityhighway driving which is a plus considering it hasnt hit 1000 miles yet This crossover should have stayed on the market longer I really think Ford made a bad decision by dropping it after just 3 years
0,Driving the new DTS is the most user friendly experience ever It does for luxury what the 07 Corvette does for performance You dont have to spend a fortune to have the best ride on the road  this car looks great and gives the passengers a feeling of safety and comfort that is top level and impressive
1,I just got back from a LONG trip through many states including going through the Appalacian mountains The trip with my family totaled over 2200 miles The Freestyle was a great vehicle offering plenty of room for a family of four with lots of luggage My experience was that it had PLENTY of passing power The CVT would ramp up to 58K RPM and the car would FLY by anything on the road Of course it sounded like the world was coming to an end Overall there was not much to complain about The computer said I averaged 23 MPG over each tank which is not bad for a car full of people and luggage
0,I love the power combined with the smooth ride of the Cadillac DTS
1,A Little noisy when driving  the AC is giving me a lot of problems the interior is kinda noisy as well
0,This is the best car I have owned in 55 years of owning and driving vehicles It is comfortable enjoyable to drive good looking and I know of no other vehicle that meets the same standard
1,When I first saw the car I did not like it Once I drove it and looked at all the safety features and options for my family I fell in love
0,I have driven many Cadillacs in this series over the years like the Concour Performance DTS etc I especially like the upgraded styling performance and new xeon lighting
1,Very happy with this car I have two kids a Great Dane and we often take other kids with us so the Freestyle is just perfect I find the engine   and transmission to be just great and we take this thing up to the mountains to ski so I think the critics are wrong the powertrain is a strength not a weakness
0,Hello I honestly believe this vehicle is superior in the Citytraveling on highways a great feeling of power at anytime tire gauge light comes on rear tire pressurefront only on right sidethey need to take care of the situation otherwise it is excellent Norman
1,Great ride Wanted an SUV but not the mileage Freestyle gives the space of an SUV but has sedanlike mileage While aesthetics are not the greatest this is a practical vehicle for people who need the space Would recommend to anyone considering an SUV
0,I recently bought my first Cadillac I traded in my Mercedes for the Escalade and i couldnt be happier We bought a 07 with 17000 miles on it It is Fantastic Living in Minnesota where the winters are the longest season it makes sense to have a SUV such as this one The only thing i wish it had was a MP3 jack for my IPOD Other than that it has everything you could want in a SUV I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anybody living in extreme climates who desire that luxury car feel
1,Traded in my 03 Yukon XL lemon and looked for a more fuel efficient wagon with 3 rows Volvo too expensive Pacifica close but pricefeatures no match Pilot great vehicle but mileage like other SUVs Since its a Ford there is no reason why you cant get invoice pricing Dont believe ads its a lie youll get about 20 to 25 mpg and there is no way youll get 500 miles to the tank unless youre coasting downhill for that many miles Overall if you are looking for non SUV nonminivan decent room with 3 row seating fuel economy feature content and price this probably is about the only option Too bad Toyota Honda Nissan had no viable option May want to check out Mazda CX9
0,Had 95 Cherokee 01 Exhibition 02 Rendevouz 04 Pacifica 05 Tahoe 04 Escalade 08 Escalade and now back to 07 Escladade ESV Hard loaded powerful beautiful with 22 wheels very dependable car that draws a crowd My other car is a C6 Corvette and both get lots of compliments My 2nd favorite was the Pacifica but like comparing apples to oranges My wife has an ML 320 that in no way compares to the Esclalade Id rather drive my sons Kia Sportage than her Mercedes We use the Cadillac for long trips and with two little girls the room in the ESV is fantastic Ill never buy another brand of SUV as long as Cadillac makes them this good
1,After a summer of driving the kids around I have to say that the Freestyle is the great family hauler Have a 2001 Windstar and decided to see if the Freestyle would as good a hauler as a minivan but with a better ride and comfort Well the answer is YES There is not as much interior space as a minivan but I am over it The Freesytle is great
0,First of all still no fold flat third row seats primitive fill er up every 4 to 5 days small gas tank and premium fuel good power seems smaller than 04 expedition which rode and handled better went a week and half on full tank seems to shake oh yeah ladies with two rows of captains chairs never go shopping with more than 4 people No room behind the third seat Stuck now should have went with a nav L
1,Purchased this vehicle after having a Mercury Monterey minivan Wife thought she would like something a little smaller so we drove the Freestyle Limited and we both agreed that this was the car for us We like everything about this vehicle with one exceptionwe had heatedcooled seats on the minivan and have only heated seats on the Freestyle Dealer advised me that cooled seats are not an available option Living in Arizona cooled seats do make a difference
0,We were debating a new family car and actually drove some mini vans and were leaning that direction I had been driving a 2005 Acura MDX which I liked but with another kid on the way needed something bigger We found a great deal on a used Escalade and bought it on the spot It has every feature you could imagine and drives like a dream in the snow Very quiet ride and comfortable for every passenger I would highly recommend the auto running boards and heatcool seats and the nav with back up camera as it would be hard to see behind you without it This is a great SUV and my only wish is that it had a better console and of course better gas mileage
1,Is fact now that a control arm defect is confirm but at 25000 mile is maintenace service were from dealer So do you want to replace the problem for  dollar419 with the same defect product Also if tried align with defect product will cause gas will burn faster and wear you tire faster Also engine correction on V belt replace To must problem Plus a copy of MADZA 6 suspension i should have just but Madza Rate now of  dollar10000 and less and year and model if paid more you got robbery
0,Love this vehicle awesome looks and powerdrives and handles like a car Heated and cooled seats are nice has all the bells and whistles but had to take back for service for auto opener for rear door and remote start not working electrical problems
1,I bought my Fusion used and immediately loved it I hadnt planned on buying a Ford and was really looking at the Camry and Accord but I fell it love with the Fusion after the first test drive It looks great It rides and handles great Its not a sports car but I have no problem passing on the freeway I have been getting 27 MPG with mixed driving The few small complaints I have about it have all been fixed in the newer models My car was totaled by a drunk driver while it was parked in front of my house and the only car Im considering to replace it is another Fusion Just a great car that is well made and thousands less than any of its competitors
0,America makes the best car on the road I love it My kids love it Guests love it It just plain has every feature and true luxury And all the features work well This car is a pleasure Much better than my old Lexus and Mercedes
1,The way it is build feel like a Toyota Corolla handle Problem with value stem in the first years Fuel burns like a toyota corolla one tank get you to dallas as for the fusion half tank Steering is bad sway can lose control if high winds of texas I believe that the computer is outside the firewall and in texas were is flood i would not buy this car if i know Plus I would not buy this car for 16000 nor 13000 for a value of the depression is quick The only way to keep track is if is sold at 11000 to 120000 and that is the max price At 24k plus miles i am think of trading it off already
0,I just ordered my 3rd new Cadillac Escalade all 3 were black I had the 04 07 and my new 08 is in I absolutely love them I will keep on buying them too I have never had one engine problem with them I use OnStar often I find that the directions and connections thru OnStar more useful than the nav I also love the hands free phone The stereo is fantastic too I have a lead foot so I love the 400 hp It comes in handy often The factory 22s are worth every penny I have friends that tried to put on aftermarket 22s and the cannot get rid of the vibration I live in upstate NY and have left them on through the winter As long as you clean them they are fine
1,I bought my Fusion after test driving the 4 and 6 and the awd I settled on the awd v6 It felt that it drove through bumps and didnt hop like I felt the fwd does The v6 is almost too much for stop and go and the brakes are super sticky Im not too fond of the tall back end Im 62 and have a hard time backing up Also the drinks are right under your shifter or your arm And the window is so tall I cant put my arm on it
0,Most impressive appearance white diamond Average 13 in town and 18 on trips Had 98 Tahoe which this replaced Ride much better and brakes improved Third row seat hard to remove when need to haul When in cruise control keeps down shifting Remote key wont work 50 percent of time Had to have AC valve replaced as was giving heated air on drivers side
1,I have owned my Fusion for two months Overall an excellent car My driving is 100 percent city and I am averaging 20 MPG There really isnt anything on the car I dont like other than I havent found a good dealer to get my car serviced at Have had a quirky thing happen  the information center says the drivers side door is open when it really is not Will have it looked at when I go in for my first oil change
0,Love the Escalade As for mileage Im pretty used to spending more at the pump already owning an SUV However it gets poor mpg Living in the city I get roughly 103 mpg The best Hwy mpg was 176 pretty much coasting downhill As for build quality could be better for a luxury truck Overall very satisfied with the Escalade
1,Had the vehicle for almost a year and it is a head turner Really do not see too many on the road and I am not sure why I put on 20 inch chrome wheels and tires and they really improved the look and steering
0,As this is now my second Escalade I do not believe as of now I will own anything else Unless they come out with something that can beat the gas mileage The exterior is great the ride is amazing and all it takes is a small tap on the gas and you feel the 400 HP As of right now GM has built a vehicle that is reliable and something that I know I can trust with my life and anyone that rides in it
1,Our 2007 V6 6speed automatic transmission AWD SEL Fusion is a fantastic car EXCEPT for the horrific incity gas mileage a pitiful 13 mpg after 1800 miles Our terrain is flat as a fritter The climate is mild 56 degrees on Feb 27 and we are both conservative gentle drivers The car did however achieve 265 mpg going and 242 mpg returning on a recent 360mile trip Its the incity stopandgo travel 95 percent of our driving that is the killer I find it incomprehensible that a 3300pound midsize car would have such terrible incity mileage in the year 2007 We enjoy everything else about the car Ford has a winner here But the mileage situation needs to be addressed
0,Ive never thought to own a Cadillac ever Oh what a complete joy to drive this Escalade I was going to get the new BMW X5 now Im so glad that I got the Escalade instead This is by far the best SUV on the market  best looking most power and everything you wanted inside My whole family loves it  my husband my two little kids and of course myself I am exited to drive it everyday Yes GM knows how to make an SUV
1,i will feel guilty if i dont share my great experiences with you Great price great car and great dealer Ford should tell the truth instead of 2331 MPG i get 2735 MPG for the first month and first 1000 miles Yes as the reviewers here said I4 is a little bit noisy when the engine speed is higher than 2000 rpm at local driving However when you drive it on highway man it is so quiet I am a Ford lover Compared to other Ford cars you can see Ford pays a lot of attention on it and try to regain the No1 position of family car Taurus lost its No1 in 1996 Fusion is very competitive from all aspects compared to my Focus it is worth to pay the extra money
0,My only complaint was the noise from towing a trailer The sound of the hitch rattling was transmited into the cab The ride in the cabin is so quiet and refined The sound of the trailer was very appparent
1,My new Fusion is awesome Bought it new with 3k miles on it the dealership used it for the commercial accounts salesman It is the SEL model with auto transmission and 4 cylinder engine It drives great the suspension and handling make it extremely fun to drive I have gotten as high as 37 mpg on a trip from Bangor ME to Coventry RI about 338 miles that was a little bit more than a half of tank I was skeptical about getting a 4 cylinder but it has some good pep when needed so no complaints I was told the 4 cylinder was the same engine used in the Ford Probe I have never been a fan of Ford but this Fusion has changed my mind
0,Purchased Dec06 about 17000 miles so far Only 2 issues battery died first month and heated seats didnt work even though cooled function worked both fixed without further incident The interior is user friendly and carlike exudes luxury huge improvement over previous generation Very comfy seats AC strong and cold in 100 temps 11mpg mixed 19mpg highway My particular truck doesnt suffer the excessive wind noise but did notice it on the loaner Changing from a CLK55AMG overall pleased with the vehicle No vehicle is perfect everyone has different needs For overall combination of size power handling luxury and utility this is currently the segment leader
1,I bought the Fusion without ever seeing one in person and I really love this car Gas mileage has been up to and over 30 MPG from the beginning I also dont have any problems getting started from a full stop of punching the pedal to get out of a tight situation The reports of slow response to gas pedal input just arent as bad as they are made out to be I am also 64 tall and have zero issues with leg and head room I also have no problems with the turning radius My previous vehicle was a Ranger which had a larger turning radius so the Fusions tighter turning is a nice change of pace
0,The sleeping giant is awake and has made one awesome vehicle This is unbelievable how nice a suv this is I love the looks you get from all types of people But you should its part of the new GM Theyre back Doesnt get any better Keep doing what youre doing You have let all know who is number 1
1,Bought this car used but spent a lot of time researching before buying FusionWanted leg room head room gas mileage room for two teenage boys and 6 year old in backGot it all with a great price too I have NEVER regretted getting this car Would not hesitate to purchase another
0,This is my 4th Escalade Overall good experience Love driving this vehicle However 2007 model is the least comfortable to drive Interior is lovely but smaller that previous years
1,wife and I both luv our fusion Economy is decent but we both like the the pedal on the right It works great Ride handling comfort all great Would put this against any car priced close Prospective buyers try this one
0,The new Escalade is extremely impressive with 400hp creature comforts galore and attractive styling The comfort level of the new Escalade is extremely high The seats are a little flat with little side support but amazing seat warmers make up for it same with the second row The GPS and rear view camera system is the best I have ever experienced even better than other Cadillacs The styling is far better inside and out than all other competitors The engine sounds great and has decent pull for such a large vehicle even though the amazing engine suffers in fuel economy I average about 12 with mostly city and the occasional highway
1,I have been very disappointed with the quality if this car I have had to replace a front wheel barring not 2 months after purchase and have had transmission problems this car does not have the power you cant pass unless your going down hill or have plenty of room it does not feel safe on the interstate The battery terminal went bad and that had to be replaced too The interior is cheap and the seats are already separating I weigh only 125 lbs and the trunk doesnt say open As far as design and comfort I love it that is why I purchased this model Unfortunately youd better love it because there is no trade in value my  dollar16000 car is only worth  dollar7600 depreciated 12 in 8 months
0,Ive had my 07 now for about 3 months All in all I love it Reading through a few reviews made me worried because of the reliability etc Ive not had a single issue with mine Only issue I have is the gas mileage But lets be honest were not buying an SUV this size for gas mileage Turning radius is incredible speed and power is perfect and the looks both in and out are top of the line bar none Expensive but worth it Ive test driven and owned several other luxury SUVs  BMW Navigator Range Rover etc and Im still glad I bought it
1,This car has down every thing it is supposed to run without any trouble Change the oil and put gas in it and maybe air up the tires that is all I have done to it Its comfortable and handles like a dream I test drove the CamryI should say rented one in FL it was brand new and I was pretty inpressed with it unit I went to close the door an the side panel fell out It just popped out in my hands with almost no effort Not my idea of quality The new Accord is ugly and expensive so off to the Ford dealer I went
0,Got my new Slade about a month ago So far has 1000 miles Love the power and comfort The 403 hp enables me to quickly pass just about anything but a gas station But I knew what I was in for and am pleasantly surprised by the highway mileage of 19 mpg Around town its less but thats the price you pay Seats are very comfortable and long drives are no problem Love the audionav system and the muted ride when the road is a bit rough But its still a truck That said theres absolutely no other vehicle Id rather have than this one Three friend recently bought Toyota Sequoia Lexus GX and Aston Martin Ill take my Escalade over them any day
1,Wanted a midsized car 4 cylinder engine manual transmission and good fuel economy After driving several Fusions as rental cars albeit with automatics liked them enough to purchase After 2 months the only complaint is the sunroof has a small rattle will take back to dealer and fuel mileage has been low even without hard accelerationstops
0,I have had this car for under a year and I have never had a car need to go to service more in my life I have had the brakes serviced 7 times already It seems like one thing after another goes wrong and for what you pay I am horrified with the amount of time I have to deal getting the car serviced I got it for the children but what a mistake I wish I had my 5 series back Please do not get this vechicle it is the worst waste of money The inside and exterior look is the only positive about this but I want to be able to drive a car not just look at it in the driveway I hope this helps you all
1,My wifes car So far the Fusion is exceeding both my and her expectations and at a great price No workmanship issues to speak of at 3400 miles A little weak in fromstop acceleration but only a 4 cylinder Great fuel economy for a car its size
0,Had it for about 1 12 months Drive it as often as I can Always look forwad to getting into it The ride is smooth quite and comfortable
1,I purchased this car after driving five F150s in a row and I am not disappointed a bit The Fusion drives nice the V6 has plenty of power and it gets great highway gas mileage The SEL has lots of great features and feels like a more expensive car
0,The vehicle is nothing less than spectacular I bought it for my wife who is totally enamored with the looks ride and performance I opted for the 20 wheels which saved acouple of bucks and were a little unique a good mix for ride quality
1,I have owned many many cars in my 46 years of driving The 2007 Ford Fusion is the best You cant best it for the price as well as performance and comfort
0,I have the 2007 AWD Escalade and if I had to sum it up the words would be perfect blend This SUV has more power than any other I have driven so when I read that it is under powered by other reviews I dont know what their comparing it to Maybe the Corvette The improvements in the interior is one the main reasons I bought this vehicle The nav system is very fast and full of information while the Bose stereo system sounds incredible the plasma screen DVD players in front and back are crystal clear I have the optional 22 rims and to me this SUV still has a smooth ride and takes bumps well So I say to people who consider this SUV compare apples to apples and you wont be disappointed
1,After searching for months I came back to the Fusion This car is a winner The styling is unique The V6 is worth a little less MPG than the 4 cyl  as it shifts flaulessly is very quiet and has plenty of power when needed By far the handling is the best After learning the underpinnings are from Volvo no wonder I thought  as my last 2 cars were Volvo and this car handles like no other import car The interior is fresh and simple  not gaudy like Camrys fake beach glass glowing controls and old folks boring bisque color scheme Get all the options even if you think you dont need them  I did and Im glad  very good value
0,I havent sold my 04 Escalade yet and I cant wait to get rid of my 07 model so that I can sit comfortably again How could GM switch the comfy seats for these cardboardones I got tired after driving for an hour bumping around on roads I used to think were smooth having my thoughts drowned in the engine road wind and interiornoise The Cashmere interior is too bright and will look old in six months It still has no flat folding 3rd row seats And it still has no telescoping steering wheel Even though the styling is generally improved mostly in the exterior front the back looks like any GMCtruck the oversleekness of the interior came with a price  loss of personality The engine sounds impressive but lacks the power to impress Overall this truck has a cheep feeling
1,The greatest thing about the Ranger is it just flat out works Yes there are other newer trucks out there but for the money it is hard to get any better than the Ranger I have had no problems with it
0,I purchased my 2007 Cadillac Escalade in March 06 when it was first released and have put about 10000 miles on it Its been flawless in every way and all the tech gadgets work the way they are supposed to As far as climate control I already suffered through a long heat wave with temps above 100 and the AC performed flawlessly You can start the car remotely and by the time you get in it it will have already cooled down considerably Once you get in and blast the AC and ventilated seats you will be pretty cold Anyway I look forward to your feedback as to how it actually performs in your area Good luck
1,Ill be completely honest here I have a bare bones 2007 ford Ranger no AC no CD no tilt no power anything and 5 speed I love it I commuted about 5060 km a day each way so roughly 100 120 a day km and I still only fuel up about every 56 days Im not talking babying it down the road Im talking about putting my foot down and opening it upI do my regular oil changes and tire rotation and one year and about 25000 kms later is has yet to fail me Again Ill be honest you want power and size in a small truck Get a Dakota If you want reliablity and wicked MPG definitely get a Ranger
0,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is an excellent truck It has a great engine It needs more leg room in front and second rows though
1,Peppy 4 cylinder suspension stiff which is OK by me great gas mileage avg 28 30 highway drive a lot of dirt roads and no rattles after 10k Old design but smallness helps with gas mileage Seats are great but Im 58 Ride height good Ill keep it until I die am 56 Im a Ford family
0,This is my 4th Escalade one was an EXT the others are the AWD models They consistently have shown very good quality reliability and performance It still rides a bit harsher than I would like but it handles reasonably well I have been sufficiently impressed with this vehicle to keep coming back to the well Its nice to drive something this nice thats built in this country actually Arlington Texas
1,My new Ranger has been in the shop 13 times in one year  7 times in the past 2 monthsOnly has 15000 km Problems started first monthserious clunking in the steering in midturn   and when accelerating from stopInner Tie rod ends have been replaced 4 times in 2 monthsc last ones were Fords newimproved ones as a result of TS Bulletins and serious problems Also had intermediate shaft replaced twice and lower steering shaft once Finally no clunking  only been a week  I am wary Dealer told me several other owners have the same problem Ford avoiding a recall In my mid40s owned 28 vehicles all makesnever had such an unreliable piece of metal in the driveway and I am a Ford fan
0,I just did a test drive on both the 07 Navigator and the 07 Escalade The BIG difference was the motor and the instrument electronics The Escalades ride was very nice as was the handling The seats in the Navigator were a bit better as was the 3rd row seating but I saw a drop off in the engineers to incorporate the electronics the way Escalade did I now own the Escalade The styling was the major factor in my decision The Navigator was a bit cheaper even with the options packages Im not buying the Escalade for gas savings but its nice to know you can use regular gas when its crunch time
1,Its been close to a year now and 10000 miles with no problems at all With the 40 and automatic I just got 22mpg on a recent trip regularly getting 16 around town Thats not bad for as much power as it has Handles like a truck not a car and thats how a truck should handle
0,Well I have been driving an Escalade for seven years now and love it Ready to try on the new 2007 model I drove to the dealership to pick it up Cadillac is well aware of my disappointment I called them This is a  dollar65000   dollar70000 truck and I felt the interior quality was significantly lower than in years past You can see dramatic cuts they made to make it seem more roomy The seats are less comfortable and the cup holders ha The windows dont power up The automatic back hatch is awesome though At least thats an improvement But bring back my confy seats I think I want my 2004 Escalade back
1,I needed a new vehicle for driving to work and back and decided to get a lower cost pickup so I could haul stuff if I needed to This little truck feels bigger than it is and runs great I have averaged 29 mpg just driving it around the area and to work and back and have gotten as high as 36 mpg on longer highwayfreeway trips I cant complain about anything in this vehicle
0,This is my first Americanmade vehicle in 15 yearsand lovin my new Escalade It has a wonderful ride and most of the features that I wanted no Bluetooth  come on GM The exterior styling is fantasticjust the right amount of chrome The interior is much improved its wonderful for an Americanmade SUV GM still has plenty to learn from Lexus BMW and Infiniti
1,I originally picked up this Ranger FX4 Level ll because of price All the foreign trucks were considerally more expensive I have a feeling this is an American website so I hope you can relate It is completely loaded with leather power everything AC sixdisk changer a class three trailer hitch bed liner and something Ford calls Wear and Tear Package Essentialy this truck can be returned with up to  dollar3500 damage at the end of the lease for which I can walk away from having to pay All for  dollar361 a month taxes in for three years Hell theyre giving these trucks away And this truck looks absolutely awesome
0,I love this truck My 9 year old son calls her the Escalady what a lady she is I have driven my 2007 Escalade for 6 months and 12000 miles I still cant get over all of the yearning stares male and female young and old and comments about what a beautiful vehicle it is After all the Escalade is at the top of the food chain Power is delivered smoothly over the entire power curve The engine runs quietly at cruising speeds Push down your right foot and experience spirited acceleration along with a throaty harmonic sound of unbridled power and arrogance Its fand finish is luxurious The import luxury SUVs dont even come close I looked at them all Cadillac is back on top
1,Overall not a bad truck Great offroad with the limited slip differential Manual trans does well with no slippage Body is okay but a little to much plastic for my personal liking
0,This is the sixteenth new Cadillac we have bought and the best one ever It makes you feel safe Its easy to drive to park has navigation OnStar and all around audio is fantastic I plan to keep this car a long time
1,I got the 2 door SuperCab XL about three months ago The Ranger is really not that bad a truck for the price My biggest complaint would be that something has come loose between the headliner and the trim on the right side of the truck and it makes a buzzing sound right in my left ear Im gonna have the dealership take a look at this I think the interior could use some more attention to detail too This truck has SEVEN different intermittent settings for the windshield wipers but has exposed bolts holding the radiofan control console onto the dash Do we really need seven different wiper speeds That aside the truck really runs well and the gas mileage is great
0,The new 2007 Cadillac Escalade has the hottest body styling on the market right now The car is tuned for speed but still can be driven comfortably The engine is wisper quiet while crusing on the highway but wakes up instantly with one touch of your right foot So if youre looking for a luxury SUV with the heart of a sports car this is the buy for you
1,I special ordered this truck with all the options I wanted I waited about 6 weeks for it to come in After a few weeks I noticed light spots in the paint on the cab sides while in direct sunlight I did not notice this before since it had been overcast The problem was pretty bad so I let warranty handle it Now the metallic in the paint does not match The dealer and Ford think this is acceptable and not noticeable but everyone else notices it without me pointing it out Now I have a new truck that I do not even want The dealers response is that is the best the paint match will be No more Fords for me I am considering taking a hit and buying another product I am extremely hacked off
0,The new 5050 body distribution of the Escalade makes for great handling and it stops on a dime The third seat air curtain is great for those who are carrying extra passengers The Escalade even has a number of color options It rides as smoothly as a sedan
1,Purchased 4 cylinder with automatic 07 Ranger based in part on positive reviews Found truck to have poor build quality with little support from Ford Makes excessive vibration from exhaust and very loud transmission whine in low gear Dealer and Ford customer relations say this is normal for this type vehicle Vehicle in shop 4 times within first month of ownership Paint on tail gate and bed sides has large metallic runs Door out of alignment Ford fix for exhaust vibration is to install clamped on weight on exhaust pipe aft of converter Fixed door alignment problem Im afraid to have paint work fixed as the color wont match Buyers better due your due diligence before purchase
0,I must say that Cadillac and GM got their act together when designing the new Escalade We have the ESV model and nothing can come close to it So far I can only say great things about this truck It truly defies its size the way it accelerates and drives It sounds like a muscle car from the outside and the 62 liter V8 loves to rev The 6speed auto is actually pretty good on gas on the highway Its a bit thirsty around town but understand we are talking about an 8passenger 3 ton vehicle here If you need the room and are looking for a first class SUV there is nothing that compares to the Escalade Write the check and get one
1,Purchased 4 cylinder with automatic Idle is very rough with vibration through steering wheel Returned to dealer 2 times Dealer said motor mounts and exhaust needed alignment No help Checked this vehicle against other similar vehicle at dealer and found other vehicle to be smoother When idle increased 25 to 50 RPM smooths out to normal Dealer says Idle can not be adjusted Had several 4 cylinder vehicles and all idle smooth Dealer says thats the way Rangers are it can not be fixed Looks like I am stuck with rough running new vehicle Should have purchased Japanese
0,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is a great vehicle We have every option in it It is very comfortable The cooled seats are great in the South The remote start option is great for warming up the engine I love everything about it
1,We just bought this vehicle and I must say it is much more stylish than some of the previous yearslove the new front The inside is a little narrow widthwise Headroom is just okay Plenty of leg room Wish seats in the extended cab were standard Very cute little truckhope it lasts a good while Ford does offer an undercoating for rust protection for  dollar299 but I elected not to get it I would recommend this truck over Chevy Dodge GMC etc It is not a bad value for the price The dark gray looks very sporty
0,After test driving multiple Escalades over the past month I have to say that I was completly let down While the exterior is absolutely stunning the interior fails to impress The interior is not of solid construction at all Opening the center console I felt like I was going to break it it is very shaky Overall the quality of the interior of the Cadillac just seemed very cheaply constructed to me The power of the engine also failed to impress me as well After driving it on the open interstate and flooring it a couple times it just failed to impress
1,The car is everything I thought it would be and more I was surprised by the amount over invoice I had to pay Horsepower handling 060 its all good No remorse whatsoever about the car
0,This Cadillac is an awesome car inside and out It has great power and all the luxury that you expect The chrome on the exterior really makes it stand out That was a big eye catcher for my husband and I We are very happy with our Cadillac and have no regrets I would tell anyone that likes Cadillac or SUVs that this is the vehicle for them
1,I am 53 years old and owned older Mustang muscle cars in the 60s and 70s but nothing like this car When the TCS system is disengaged the raw horsepower is frightening You better be ready for whats about to happen when you step on it Its hard to drive it and not put your foot in it every time you stop and take off again Ive never ridden on the space shuttle but I cant imagine the rush being any greater
0,Hi I recently purchased my Escalade and prior to that I owned a 2004 GMC Yukon Denali Let me tell you there is no comparison between the two The new Escalade is just built so much more solidly I am so glad that I choose this truck I recommened it to any one looking for a real head turner
1,Bought this car for a little over msrp I have been lucky enough to own several true sports cars in my life from all the major brands This car is a blast from 0 to 60 But when the new wears off the interior looks just like Mustang GT and the build quality is not what it should be I think the Shelby team should have spent a little more time on the interior and fit and finish to make this a 10 out of 10 Also Ford dealers are trying to charge way to much over msrp for this car
0,This my sisxteenth brand new Cadillac it is the best yet It rides and drives like my sedans and makes me feel like the Queen of the Road It has great pick up is easy to park and makes me feel protected
1,I paid msrp for my Vista Blue GT500 It was worth if I have a SVT Cobra and didnt buy this car because of the Shelby name I have always want to see what a SC 4V 54l would do in a Mustang My car will not be a garage queen I picked my car up in MI and drove it 1600 miles back to FL in 19 hours Only gripe was the car is to quiet Didnt sound like a Mustang should Very fun cant wait until more parts come out and we start seeing the GT500 putting down 500600 rwhp
0,My previous problem with the rear view camera has gone away and now I am left with a vehicle that is just incredible The power is awesome the comfort level is great and its a ton of fun to drive
1,I traded in my Z06 for this car and paid way over sticker Thought at the time I had to have it Shame on Ford for letting dealers charge way more than msrp for the car Thats what is wrong with Ford and why no one wants to get ripped off by them Save some money and get a Vette or wait for the price to drop
0,I confessthe 07 Cadillac Escalade appearance sucked me in There have been many changes in to it for 07 like a new ft suspension punched out the 60 to 62L added more HP heated and cooled seats a heated steering wheel and other great creature comforts If you have a need for a large SUV this is the one The gas mileage is great for its class Dont hate the luxury sport UTILITY vehicle and its mileagehate the people who buy one with out really needing them If your like me and spend a lot of time in your vehicle tow occasionally haul light materials Maybe it is time you pampered yourself It is everything I expected The 08 model can only get better from here
1,In Dec of 07 I purchased a used 2007 Ford Taurus from a Ford dealer In Dec of 08 the transmission went and the dealer tells me the warranty has expired 2 years old   and 44000 mi and I have to pay for a new tranny My mechanic tells me that the factory tranny in this car is not good Either way I suggest the extended warranty
0,My last three cars have been a Dodge a Lincoln and now General Motors What a disaster The Escalade is a nice truck and it rides well but the rearview camera has not worked right from day one Service rearview camera flashes on the screen when going from park into drive The service staff at my Cadillac dealership are totally clueless and pretty much dont care Maybe they will care when GM gets my survey The truck only has 250 miles
1,I replaced a Buick Regal This 07 Taurus the worst handling car I have ever owned It drives horribly Terrible understeer Transmission is a real dog Shifts are delayed either slowing down or speeding up Yes I know it is an automatic but this transmission is bad My 83 Escort drove and handled better than this 07
0,This truck is much improved I traded in my 2005 for it and I can honestly say that I like the look and feel of the 07 model much better The extra cost was well worth it
1,Ive owned 88 94 9702and now the 07 Taurus The 02 was the best overall I like a combination of reasonable size safety and overall economy of operation Im averaging right at 27mpg overall with most of my driving on the interstate I did better on my 02 with the 24V engine My current 07 has 3 front seatbelts which allows for six passengers something many newer sedans do not offer If I had the purchase to do over I would find the SEL model for some better interior quality and for extra features however this seems to be a good car so far Only one issue so far front driver side window went down but would not come up Only happened one time I think something may be loose
0,This is one of the nicest SUVs on the market I looked at all makes this time before buying and after a test drivewas sold I love it
1,I had a 2003 Ford Taurus SE before which was a very good car I had the car until October 2007 when a crash on the interstate totalled it The incident on the highway tested a few things on the car like braking handling and safety It is a very safe car The 08 version is the safest in American if you havent seen the commericial The Taurus has been criticized for it looks but Id much rather crash in an ugly American car then a cheap Japanese one I liked the car so much I have now bought the 2007 model in SEL which is quite similar apart from a few minor improvements on the looks and has leather seats air con etc
0,I bought this vehicle a month ago and I like it very much Now Lexus and other luxury manufacturers have competition in the SUV segment Cadillac has shown a great improvement with the production of this ultimate large size SUV I am so glad to see that the brakes have also been improved The interior is also very nice I like the rear view camera I love its ride on road and also on off road It has the great power and torque Its 6 speed gear box is also quick responding I have taken this large size monster to the hottest area of my country and even at 52 degree centigrade my vehicle was able to travel at high speeds I was surprised to see that from an SUV
1,I purchased one of the earliest Acadias April 2007the top of the line version with all the featuresAWD etc Truck was great for about 8 months and then I had one of the software updates applied and it changed something about the transmission in a significant way I could tell immediately upon picking up the vehicle Car cant find right gear to be in sluggish up the slightest hills poor gas mileage 13mpg max poor acceleration wheezing Well 2 weeks and 3 days ago at 37800 miles THE END Tranmission crapped out with my whole family in the car Guess what No Acadia transmissions available at all because GMs suppliers have cut back production Who knows how long Ill wait
0,This is my 4th Escalade I started buying them in 02 This seems to be the best one yet it continues to look great especially in black with 22 wheels The navigation system is easy to use but has had glitches When it warms up and the vehicle is shut off it will not resume operation stating disc misread The ride is very good as it has been in all of my previous models and it continues to be easy to manuever This one is very fast for an SUV this big its just 05 seconds slower 060 than my 1970 GTO Judge Its build quality appears to remain solid and dealer service has in the past been excellent and local which is great I will continue to purchase this model
1,We had 3 engine failures in about a years period of time For no apparent reason the engine would just stop It didnt matter if we were in traffic on a major highway or making a turn When the engine quits you no longer have brakes or steering that the average person could use We ask GMC to get us into another Acadia since our lives were being put at risk in this car but all they did was offer to extend our OnStar
0,I have had 4 Escalades 3 Devilles 2 Sevilles and one CTS Every single time I want to get a new model I go out and test drive other makes and models andgo back to Cadillac The new Nissan Armada is just like driving a big old bulky trucknot AT ALL like the Escalade the Lexus GX 470 disappointed me also as did the BMW too small and Mercedes too small The Lincoln Navigator also was short changed on the interior it just felt plasticlikeNOTHING like the Escalade The 2007 has pep and can bust out at the light or passing on a two lane road The changes from 2006 to 2007 are PROMINENT and VERY WORTH WHILE I also would rate this gem as one of the SEXIEST SUVs on the market
1,We purchased the Acadia in Feb 2007 and 2 12 years later the transmission failed The dealership admitted to a bulletin being issued about the transmission We had a recall repaired with the transmission like most a few years ago but it is now completely shot Thank God for the extended warranty because GMC is not willing to repair or replace this defective transmission in my two year old car I am disappointed to say the least The radio is defective as well they have replaced it twice I loved this car even though it was in and out of the shop for recalls but this is a lemonI will be speaking to attorney
0,The dealershipI am a repeat customer was helpful and the vehicle exceeded my expectations in luxury and comfort The exterior design is great but the added creature comforts inside this next generation of Escalade are amazing The seats are so comfortable and the instrument panel is very clear and easy to read day and night I cant praise this SUV enough
1,Purchased approximately two weeks ago so far not disappointed at all Interior design is excellent but I have also noticed the glare on the AC vents mentioned in other reviews but not a serious issue for me The motor and transmission are extremely smooth and I dont have any problems with the six speed it wants to get into 56 gears as quick as possible but a slight tap on the accelerator down shifts it quickly Mileage overall is aveaging about 185 mpg in a blend of 50 percent cityhighway A 100 mile interstate trip did deliver 22 and I averaged 75 mph You cant do that in my 03 Tahoe which I traded
0,Yeah the 2007 Cadillac Escalade is pretty much a great vehicle IT drives nicely and looks hot going down the road Id reccomend it to anyone looking for comfort AND style Fo sho buy one today
1,Would like more hp when accelerating to get onto freeway or pass another vehicle vehicle is a little sluggish in that area Fuel economy is ok 17 mpg city Otherwise overall excellent ride so far
0,This is by far the best Escalade yet It drives as smooth as butter is extremely comfortable has load of power with the 403 hp engine and gets average fuel mileage I traded in a 2004 Range Rover and havent regretted it for one second Its a real head turner and gets looks everywhere I go I would highly recommed this vehicle Theres nothing like a Cadillac
1,We have enjoyed our Acadia and having over 1000 miles we are ready for the road ahead The engine noise a little noisy on heavy acceleration the dash imperfection is anoying but I had the dealership take care of this I could not have abuilt a better vehicle myself
0,This new rebuild of the Escalade is awesome They have made many improvements from their older models The new dash layout is fantastic especially if you get it with the info package The touch screen navigation is easier to navigate then with buttons and knobs The instrument panel competes with many other luxury vehicles as well And one great feature that this truck has that I have not seen on any other cars is the intellibeam system which puts the highbeams on when it pitch black this is great for turnpike driving when theres oncoming vehicles Overall I think General Motors out did themselves and I would recommend this truck to anyone
1,Before you take a trip read all details in the manual Lots of buttons to learn about before you push them Do not rely on the Park Assist horn to warn you Watch the amber lite and stop dead when three lights are lit
0,This is my third Escalade Have had an 02 and 04 and now 07 This is the best yet They solved most all of my issues with previous models Dash is lower and well laid out visibility better both fore an aft Seats are a little smaller but still very comfortable New 6 speed tranny is much better on response through the full range and seems to get better mileage than my 04 Navigation system is a vast improvement Ride is much more controlled Plush without giving up responsiveness Fold and tumble seats are nice but having to manually put them back up is a waste Power lift and close rear gate is a wonderful feature
1,I just took a 1000 mile trip and was miserable I kept hitting my head on the tilted head of the seat and had a crick in my neck my entire trip The seats are so firm they feel hard The lumbar support feels like it never releases and both drivers on my trip had backaches The only positive was the front window has good visibility in the rain I am sorry I bought this car since I travel frequently The FM radio has poor reception so you must pay for XM The car is slow and the gas pedal is hard to push and you must lift your foot at a severe angle to reach I cant believe I read so many good reviews This car is slow eats gas and is just plain uncomfortable
0,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is an awesome truck Its Lexuslike interior and and elegant and classy exterior along with 403 hp combine to make this a stunning vehicle Cadillac really hit a major home run with this one
1,Congratulations GMC this car blows away the competition The styling is excellent and unlike others complaints I see about inital gas mileage I am averaging 20mpg in heavy Chicago area traffic where my average speed is about 17mph with many starts and stops I am sure I could make it average a lot less like some of the complaints here if I really tried by accelerating hard This is a great alternative to gas guzzling large SUVs or minivans The ride and quiet interior are better than the Acura we own or the Volvo we used to own Best in class legroom for all three rows of seating without sacrificing cargo space
0,The 2007 Escalade is unbelievable in almost every aspect It has plenty of power with outstanding fuel milage Its ride is top notch better than most luxury cars This is the premier vehicle to have
1,Expecting equal or better fuel economy to my last vehicle which was a Jeep I was disappointed to only get about 14mpg average 30 percent lower than expected The ride is smooth although after 3 months rattles with the doors and undercarrage have started to appear a few features like the rear wiper switch being on the highbeam switch which easily gets turned on by mistake when switching the highbeams and chrome accents that reflect the sun in your eyes But for the little amount of snow I drove it in the handling and traction was great Dont let anyone lean on your Acadia as the panels dent easy For a GM vehicle it was better than expected but still not great
0,I bought my 2007 Cadillac Escalade three days ago and I couldnt be any happier When I drove off the dealership parking lot I felt like I was in another world This SUV is amazingly powerful and outstandingly comfortable The mileage isnt as great as my old Tahoe had but this truck gives you a lot for the money you pay It has awesome electronic gadgets and a lot of room for anyone who wants to ride I plan on modifying it a little bit to make it the true babe magnet This SUV has totally made me the happiest person on earth
1,I was very concerned buying a new GM vehicle after owning a Honda Pilot for the last 4 yrs and picked this over the new MDX This vehicle is much quieter on the hiway is larger inside more HP and same gas mileage as the Pilot Love the dark carpets even with the taupe leather very comfy seats and hidden receiver hitch chrome door handles Wish I couldve purchased front moonroof only Tranny cant decide which gear to pick on hills at hiway speed nature of the 6 speed beast Highly recommend backup sensors due to small tailgate window
0,The 2007 Escalade blows all other SUVs out of the water It has 403 Hp which nobody else can touch not Hummer or Lincoln I love this vehicle Cadillac did a great job of slightly compacting the SUV and further improving its aggility and great ride To anyone who is looking for a luxury SUV this is the vehicle for you
1,Leased the vehicle thinking I would get close to the the MPG listed as I mostly drive at highway speeds and few if any stops Best MPG I have gotten so far is 164 but avg only 147 weekly I was told this engine would break in and I would get better MPG but after 1200 miles I doubt this will come up that much to match the sticker claims I love this car as it meets every other need I have but to suffer at the pumps is getting the best of me I also have a problem with the transmission not always being in the proper gear on grades This could be a major factor in the low MPG I recommend GM look into this further I grow more angry at every fillup
0,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade looks great and drives great Its new opitions have Cadillac written all over them The new Escalade is finally a true Cadillac
1,I just bought this car for my wife Carbon Metallic with Ebony Leather the DVD player and dual sunroofs everything is on it I have to say the car is great Tows well drives like a car and my wife loves it No doubt it will be in my garage for another 5 years If crossoversSUVs are what you are looking for just dont bother and buy this car
0,What do you buy used for  dollar50K Answer a low mileage late model Denali for  dollar30K and save the  dollar20K The dealership experience was top of the line But we are having the black paint redone interior detailed and some work completed under warranty We have had the unit for 4 weeks and driven her 5 times We are so spoiled by having 20 yrs of experience with Lexus decided to try the ESV since it really looks so wonderful Get past the looks this isnt worth the 70K new and questionable if worth the  dollar42K we spent If I ever decide to be more positive about this experience I will write you an update
1,Took delivery on Feb 9 2007 and 2 weeks later left for 5 week vaction in Florida Drove 4617 miles and got 1983 mpg Not too bad for vehicle this size in very heavy Florida traffic About 22 mpg on the highway according to computer Was considering a van but am extremely happy I choose an Arcadia GM has definitly got a hit with this vehicle Highly recommend at least a look
0,i just bought a new esv and i love it its so good to drive and has good comfort the bad part in this car is the sound its so good but it works bose sound system if you are looking for a car this is the one that i highly say yes to 
1,We were impressed with all the supposedly included features until we actually bought the car and found out many of them do not function in all the models ie the drivers information center on the base models We felt the features could be changed to meet our needs After having the cartruck for a week we have found out that while they are there and functioning they only function the way the engineers at GMC choose to make them function In particular is the door locks They lock as expected when you put the car into gear The problem is they unlock automatically when ever you put the Acadia into park ie waitng at a train crossing in the worse part of town
0,Im only 5 feet tall and was scared to purchase this car Boy was I pleasantly surprised It handles beautifully and I have no problems at all with it It is so beautiful inside My boys love the DVD system It is the King of SUVs Im so happy we purchased this
1,Saw the Acadia at a car show first Was and still impressed with comfort features and looks of this car Will be a great car to take on vacations and other trips I have not really tested the performance of car due to the fact it is not fully broken in With the 275 hp I am sure it will have plenty power I am very disappointed in the gas mileage that the car gets 162 is the best Ive recorded and thats 95 percent hwy driving and driving at 65 mph nowhere near the window sticker estimate of 17 city and 24 hwy Any answers GM I have a feeling the mpg wont improve much even after 10K miles Compared to my Murano I traded the room is much better but I miss the fuel economy of the Murano Overall GM did a great job on this crossover I would recommend it to friends
0,I bought my first Escalade in April of 06 There have been so many problems and design flaws First and foremost why would you put the DVD player under the seat You cant even stretch your legs without kicking it The wireless headphones broke easily The third row is pretty much for babies and toddlers only The legroom is comical Too much plastic too Sometimes the DVD player wont turn off too No fold flat seats or MP3 jack and the second row seats are really loud when you let them down On the bright side the performance is outstanding the interior quality is great and I love all of the features
1,I had this vehicle for 2yrs and I had been several times back to the dealer for many recalls they broke my wind shield now my roof is leaking in the front and the rear where my DVD ent sys alot of water I immediately took it to the GM service they witness said they will fix it I spent good money on this I shouldnt have been to the GM service so many times
0,Over all we love this vehicle however we are very unhappy with the wind noise and have had it into the dealership 4 times to try and have it corrected The dealership has done everything the manufacturer has recommended and there has not been much improvement it sounds like the windows are not all the way up and is very annoying as we did not plan on spending money and have this problem Love the seats with the AC as we live in Florida Drives beautifully
1,I have owned it for almost two years  22000 miles Not one problem and it rides better today than when I purchased it I owned a Highlander and this is much much better My mileage has improved in the last year When I bought it there where not squeaks or rattles  I hoped it would remain like that  not sure if its better but it couldt be quieter Love this vehicle
0,I enjoy every aspect of my big bold and beautiful ESV It is very comfortable for my legs at 66 I love the strong growl of the engine its like a muscle car on steroids I guess its an SUV with an asterisk I was very careful before spending over  dollar60K for a vehicle I did the comparisons with all the other leading luxury SUVs  none compared in features and power 403 horsepower This SUV is the King I bought this car becauase I liked everything about it I never thought I would so many looks and compliments and thumbs ups in traffic This SUV turns heads I have no idea how sane person could give this SUV a bad rating Go drive it for yourself
1,We bought in March paying much more for this vehicle than another we considered We mainly got it for the promised MPG It has not lived up to my expectations at all The gas mileage is horrible 1214 in town 1910 hwy and I am a very conservative driver Its been in the shop about 5 times in 6 months minor issues but still The gold paint job is evidently not very good There was a small scratch when we got it which we touched up Since then it has gotten many more scratches from items that dont normally scratch off car paint The AC doesnt work well when outside temp is 80 or below although it is great in the hottest part of the summer and we have black interior
0,After coming out of a 03 Navigator I believe Caddy stepped up to the plate I test drove the 07 Naviagator and Expedition The Escalade ESV is a superior vehicle 103hp is considerable The exterior styling is very well executed
1,I purchased the vehicle one year ago and still cant seem to get all the the bugs out It has been in the shop multiple times for vauious reasons The first problem we incountered was the seatbelts tearing We are now on the fourth seatbelt for the diver side and still having a problem The second problem was the back compartment door that would not close The sunroof leaks causing the passenger side floor board to get wet from a drain tube not installed properly still having problems with this We also had the software upgrade The preformance since has been alot better but the gas mileage has dropped tramendous 14 city 19 highway We are very disapointed with this vehicle over all
0,I have had Chevy Trucks for years but this thing is awesome It has unreal braking capability for such a large vehicle and great accleration too I love the styling and the interior is extremely comfortable and roomy I am 69 with long legs I cant say enough about it
1,I researched this vehicle for several months before making the purchase In the 1 yr that I have owned the vehicle it has been in the shop multiple times for various reasons The first 3 times was because the passenger side floor board was flooded because the drain from the sunroof was not installed and when my dealer did install it it was done incorrectly Then carpet had to be replaced Transmission in the vehicle is not what it should be I had the software update but car continues to shift up and down with little regard to terrain Now it is in the shop related to what they say are body seam cracks I love this car the way it rides the looks and the interior comfort
0,This is my fifth Cadillac Escalade It is just a great SUV It is one of the best vehicles that I have driven in many years
1,Ive had my Acadia for close to a year and a half and still absolutely love the vehicle For the first year we were extremely disappointed with the mpg I drove a country road to work  with one stop two stop signs on it18 milesand about 10 miles driving in town I now keep my speed under 60 mph out of town I dont pass anyone unless theyre driving under 50 mph like farm equipment I accelerate slower and coast when approaching a stop sign I always shut the car off and walkinno driveups at the bank McDs etcand wow what a difference Ive gotten on average 24 mpg in two months its been between 22 mpg and 28 mpg A savings of 4 gallons per week  You do the math
0,This truck is truly amazing and rides and handles as though it is substantially smaller The perfomrance is fantastic and the fit and finish are top notch I have the White Diamond with the Ebony interior When comparing this truck to the European and Asian large SUVs the ESV wins on space and comfort Besides the rumble of the V8 engine sounds like my 71 Vette The NAV system and the entertainment system are great along with the rear camera Air conditioned seats are a feature I thought I never needed and now wonder on those hot summer days how we did without Its gas mileage isnt to bad for its size Remember it weighs close to 3 tons so 14 mpgs aint too shabby I have gotten over 17 on the highway
1,We like our 2007 Acadia It would be love if not for the annoying vibration of the steering wheelcolumn and the constant whiny sound coming from the transmission or steering wheel Gas mileage is terrible even worse after we had the computer software update Moving east and will soon be shopping for AWD If GMC doesnt get its act together with this steering columntransmission issues the Honda Pilot might be our next new vehicle purchase
0,I went from a 2003 Ford Excursion to the best SUV on the planet I love my Caddy from bumper to bumper I have all the bells and whistles on my Escalade Compared to all of the previous SUVs that Ive owned none come close to the dynamic handling superior interior and powerful engine The ESV is the SUV bar none
1,Traded in a Yukon SLT for this vehicle Very happen with the driveability of the Acadia Mileage is not as advertised nor all that much better than a Yukon Drives more like a car than a truck Have had mini vans this has almost the same amount of storage space Have had seals replaced on transfer case already for leaking Also had a time on freeway where I had to kick it down to passing gear and absolutely nothing happened  could have been a potential hazard Update to vehicle electronics afterward may have rectified problem
0,This is an amazing SUV They have improved the engine it now has 403hp It has a spacious trunk compared to the regular Escalade It drives great its not that fun to drive around due to its size but its really great on trips
1,My wife loves the car but I am still not sure I am a large man and I am not very comfortable in the driver seat It is somewhat cramped and I have to lower it down and slide it all the way back to get any room There are some issues with the front tire sensors constantly saying check tire pressure or icey roads may occur even when it is warm and tires are inflated properly Our oldest child has very little room in the third seat and it is not easy to get to the oil filter when servicing Also a little big for the transmission seems to shift very frequently or seems to be under a load constanly AC is not up to par
0,Ive had luxury cars and Ive had SUVs This one brings it all together in one package It provides great styling and a great ride Its interior is really classy It has lots of luxury items throughout The navigation system and backup rear camera are both really top notch Mine is black and came with 22 inch chrome wheels I have never had a car that gets so many looks running down the street I know part of that is because it is so new and after all it IS a Cadillac but the bold front grille and clean lines with just the right amount of chrome really grabs attention The engine has lots of power and acceleration not like a big vehicle at all I cant wait to get in it going to or coming home from work
1,The ride   and handling of this SUV is not as good as my previous SUVs ie the Honda Pilot or Landrover Disco II but the interior space   and layout more than make up for that This is an SUV built more for the riders than the driver The engine is a bit lacking in power due to the weight   and an average of 14 mpg city   and 17 mpg on the hwy is a bit disappointing
0,I love it I went from an 03 ESV to the 07 and what a difference the new one has an awesome interiorit is very comfortable and everything is where it should be It rides nice and appears to handle much better than the 03 A couple of additional items would have made this the perfect truck Bluetooth Autoup windows and better fuel economyearly indications are about 10 MPG city  14 MPG Highwaya far cry from the 13 City  19 Hwy that are found in other reviews
1,I love my Acadia but Id love it a lot more if it was dependable We bought this car to be the new family ride but 2 weeks after purchasing it we started having problems The car wont start at times and we need a jump to get it going Once started runs fine This is not a cold start problem and the battery has been replaced and it still has problems The dealership has been great trying to solve the problems but the manufacturer rep and the car itself have been a little difficult We have named our car Sybill and are now considering the lemon law to get it replaced
0,The ride is much more comfortable than my GMC Denali It handles and responds wellIt has plenty of storage roomIt accelerates great and corners well I would recommend this truck luxury vehicle to anyone that asks However it could stand some improvements to compete with the imports
1,We have had numerous problems with are Acadia Leaks through the roof onto the head liner rear wind shield wiper would not turn off for two days electronic front passenger seat jerks when you adjust it backwards and forwards and the gas tank is smaller than what I am used to I took this vehicle on the east coast for work and was not satisfied with its acceleration or its gas mileage Also if you crack the window when it is raining the water just pours into the vehicle Signed not very satisfied
0,This is my fourth EXT and by far the best It rides like a luxury car not a truck After 20000 miles it still rides like I just purchased it Plaudits to Cadillac on this one
1,The head rest are too small and are not comfortable The AMFMOnStar antenna is to tall for a 66 garage had to modify with nylon wire ties to park in garage The six speed transmission has a difficult start on ice and snow First gear is too low and there is no option to start out in second gear Jerky ride on very bumpy road because of the low gearing I should have rented this car to evaluate prior to purchase I would have never have purchased this car
0,Wow What a beautiful truck Powerful functionality as a truck but luxurious appointments all in one The exterior turns heads and receives many compliments But the interior is wonderful  great style nice materials an incredible Bose surround sound system Life is good in this truck
1,Our family loves the new Acadia but it seems to be mysteriously accumilating miles Our GMC dealer has been great but since the transmission recall campaign the service department can not duplicate the problem The problem appears to be in one or all three of the computers GMC needs to figure this out fast Until then I would like them to buy back the vehicle
0,Very quiet and smooth Nice new features Lots of power However does not feel quite as quick as my 04 EXT that only had a 4 speed automatic   and 345 HP Acceleration from lower speeds feels like the engines power is not fully making it to the wheels Acceleration from higher freeway speeds is awsome This vehicle does so many things well that it is hard for me to consider driving anything else Lets see It has nice overall styling great power luxury seating  interior   and comforts that match just about any luxury vehicle plus tremendious utility Could use an MP3 bluetooth hookup and more cubby storage spaces insideThose minor things aside a safe practical vehicle for many purposes
1,2007 Acadia AWD is Junk Run from it The car broke down after 20 minutes owning it SPent more time in the garage then with me Then started to shut off while I am making turns on the highway for no reason Got a replacement car which we paid more for and this car is doing the same thing We are lucky no one got killed yet and GMC will not refund our money and they know this car is a death trap and I have 3 children endangering their lives by driving this crapUnbelievable They put the new updates on it now the car is worse Keeps hesitating like its going to shut off then you get whiplash when you put the gas on Some kind of hesitation
0,The new EXT is bold and fresh Chrome details really stick out give this vehicle a real wow factor Not only is it fun to drive but the EXT also serves some utility features as well The power sidesteps are pretty neat also If you really want to stand out and drive in the lap of luxury this vehicle is for you As far as gas mileage goes dont buy one if you will have trouble filling it up
1,I like my Acadia AWD but it does have some drawbacks The gas mileage is no where near what it should be I bought the vehicle thinking that the gas mileage was a bit better than my previous SUV 4wd but it isnt The continuous shifting on the CVT transmission eats gas Another problem is the vehicle is extremely difficult to backup There are many blind spots in this vehicle that should be looked at If a small car comes up behind you and you can only see the roof there is a definite problem There are also blind spots where the front seats and door jams meet causing a big blind spot when looking out the passenger side window I do like the size and comfort of the vehicle
0,Solid built truck with the luxury you can not add to any other truck Downside is only aftermarket Bluetooth
1,After enjoying my Envoy for nearly 90000 miles the Acadia has been a great step forward in size economy and ride My only dislike is the transmissions desire to get into overdrive too early and wanting to stay there too long This makes driving using the cruise control unpleasant with frequent agressive down shifting on even very small increases in grade Two computer updates have helped significantly but the frequency of the shifting is still quite annoying One other design flaw for me is the inability to open the rear gate window Makes bringing long items home more of a challenge It will be interesting to watch the developement of this vehicle over the next few years
0,The vehicle is stunning A real head turner I love the ride and quietness I previously owned two Avalanches and there is no comparison I do miss the captains chairs and the storage theAvalanche had with all the cubby holes etc I dont like the center console setup of the Escalade
1,The comfort of the car is outstanding but it does not get close to the 26 mpg on the highway as advertised and it is extremely slugglish going up any type of hill or passing a vehicle We did take it to the dealership but they couldnt find anything wrong Also the radio system a Bose is good but you cant distinguish the back speakers from the front The folding down of the 3rd seat is really easy
0,I bought this truck just before Thanksgiving after haggling with the uncooperative dealer for a month It was well worth the wait It has superb styling and comfort beautiful Diamond White paint 22 wheels and best of all NO sunroof The Escalade EXT has excellent power and great handling for a truck but terrible fuel economy Also the lack of interior storage space is disappointing it does not even have a sunglasses holder like my Suburbans had The console storage is very limited and anything stored in the top part is dumped around every time the lower console is accessed It has a great instrument panel layout The heatedcooled seats are very comfortable I love the heat for my sore old back This truck has superb headlights and driving lights
1,Great vehicle howevver transmission is a disaster MPG is bad FM reception is bad HUD heads up display works intermittently Seats get uncomfortable on long trips Hands free calling is poorly thought out Bluetooth would be a better option Turn by Turn Navigation downloads fail often
0,This truck is very beautiful It makes people stare They come up to you in parking lots and gas stations to comment on the beauty I have a 2006 Cadillac STS V8 fully loaded and it has been parked since I got the Escalade I am 65 and this truck has ample leg room and head room It also has a great ride I am looking forward to a road trip in the spring This truck is beautiful versatile and powerful I would recommend the 2007 to anyone
1,Drives well for the first 2000 miles gas mileage 22 on the road14 on lots of up and down roads in the NC mountains which is not bad Comfort of seats very good with lumbar lots of storage removed 3rd seats and rear storage compartment for the trip which provides additional room for everything your bringing along due to added height about 8in the rear area The optional method of shifting manually while in low range seems to work well in the mountains on steep grades Fuel gauge seems to operate in correctly when parked on hills giving false reading lower than it actually is Once it is driven for a while it returns to correct operation
0,I must say I am very impressed with this truck Although you can feel the weight behind the truck the ride comfort and performance are excellent I love the functionality of having a truck for the occasional tow and the ability to haul the periodic large purchase I traded my 2004 Silverado LT for the refinement of the Cadillac Despite the fact that the two vehicles are completely incomparable the only downfall to the Cadillac is that it is too gorgeous to get dirty The EXT is definitely a headturner I think GM has the most market for the highend truck However if the functionality of having a truck didnt prevail my wife liked the BMW X5s interior over the Escalades
1,We traded in our 2005 Yukon for this vehicle Were not sorry we did The interior and exterior are nicely put together It seems like GM is finally trying to do things right It is fun and comfortable to drive Overall were pleased with the vehicle but think some things can be improved on First the mileage while better than the Yukon is not what they advertise it to be Second the sun visors are useless for sun coming in from the side These need to be longer or have an extender built in Last the Navigation system DVD is not perfected The unit keeps freezing up We have had out unit replaced twice now
0,I have bought two new Escalades An 02 and an 04 but I have to tell you Cadillac out did themselves with the 07s This truck drives and handles like you cannot believe The dealer gave me a new Escalade SUV to drive until my EXT came in two weeks later It drove fantasticly as does my EXT The driving experience is night and day between the earlier models and the redesigned 07 This is my first EXT and it is a blast I have been given a lot of nice truck comments with the SUVs but man they are coming fast and furius with the EXTheads turning every which way Only bad thingI paid full list for the EXT Ouch Well to be the first on the block I guess you have to pay to playlol
1,We rented this for 4 days and I must say GM has come a long way from my Dads 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme This one had pretty much everything except navigation Drove very nice Good acceleration but the transmission seems to want to shift up too quick Radio lacks treble Build quality could be better some really badly aligned panels on side of seat rubs console when moving seat Remote start wouldnt work consistently Fuel economy seems low used about 34 tank in about 200 miles ac on always Handles good for a large car Too much chrome inside looks a bit cheap Ugly Taillight design like the LED though 2nd row seat folding design seems fragile may not last
0,The new Cadillac Escalade EXT is the phattest Cadillac ever It is a major upgrade over the 06 model Everything from the styling engine and cabin is better Its by far the hottest vehicle on the road
1,Always owned Toyotas bought this because it was cheap and had a lot of power out of the 4 cylinder Motor is weak unless heavily gouged A lot of cheap features inside check engine light comes on all the time cheap plastic bumper cracked and fell off Seat in uncomfortable at best Lot of cab room but the cheap interior kinds of kills that
0,December 30th will be 1 year since we leased this car Since then we have replaced 1 battery 6 tires all locations 2 front wheels a timing chain a steering rack and a CV joint While the servicing dealer has been great the fact remains that we still have a vibration or rumble at various speeds Since filing lemon law papers and bringing back car for last chance repair we are now informed that this is typicalusual to this car They didnt say that the first 4 times car was in   and they replaced wheels and tires Otherwise we love the car
1,I bought my SLE Crewcab 5 cyl auto 4x4 last August worked it hard this past record snowfall winter The 4wd and locking rearend made it unstoppable The truck listed at  dollar256K after rebates dealing and GM points paid  dollar185K before tax This was about  dollar10K less than Toyota or Nissan I do mainly city driving short trips only 34K milesyear so mpg is not a great concern I am not surprised that it wasnt hitting the epa ratings considering the few miles on the truck short trips cold weather and use of 4wd
0,Ive never written a review before but I felt this car deserves one I cant say enough nice things about this cargreat ride easy to handle sharp styling Lots of fun to drive and very roomy
1,Yeah Ill admit I wanted a Tacoma xtracab but I bought an American truck with more features and at a better price Yes the fit and finish is not the same as Toyota but it is close My only complaint is freeway wind rush coming from the drivers side 12 door which isnt much If you have the sunroof which I think is pretty cool no one else has it you need a wind deflector Yes the interior is simple but I didnt think it was cheap looking The factory 6 disc player cranks pretty good too The 29l is the best 4 cyl I ever sat behind and it gets damn decent mileage  dollar8000 less than a Tacoma I have enough left over to buy a new Titus Mtn Bike
0,I just bought an SRX It rides so good We have 2 kids And they do not like to sit in the same seat so the thrid row comes handy We put in a DVD player I love the sunroof and the one in the thrid row
1,I would absolutely recommend the Canyon Great horsepower and towing capacity for a smaller truck Quiet ride and excellent quality from the Profressional Grade Division of General Motors Makes the Tacoma look silly
0,Cadillac is unable to resolve a problem with hesitation when going up hills Otherwise car handles well and is essentially a large station wagon Gas mileage is poorer than window sticker
1,Weve had mostly fordsafter 10 yrs with a 97 GMC Safari AWD   and no issues we decided to look at GMC Our 96 Lincoln continental 96 was nothing but trouble   and poorly built so we didnt consider Ford We tried the new Saturn Outlook and found it to be too large   and the cost woptions too high We test drove the Toyota Highlander   and offroad Toyota as well as the Nissan SUV The Toyota was souless   and they wouldnt negotiate The Nissan was ok but the interior was bland We chose the Envoy Denali because we wanted the towing capability durability of a truck and the better fuel mileage the Denalis 8 cylinder with 4 cylinder cutout offered We average 18 in city and 22 hywy 1 yr later we r 100 percent hapy
0,The Cadillac SRX is a nice crossover SUV that is often overlooked by people shopping in this price range who often buy the Acura MDX I really didnt want an MDX becuase it is considered a mommy Mobile so I chose the SRX I am very impressed with it so far it has great handling a nice ride and a very luxurious interior The only demerits are a couple of squeaks from the cargo area and some occasional wind noise
1,I bought this SUV because I was really drawn to the style and outside appearance of the vehicle I also fell in love with the interior I have leased Nissan vehicles in the past and my husband talked me into looking at GMC I thought it was everything I wanted in an SUV so we purchased the SUV instead of leasing I travel on the highway 90 percent of the time and I was so disappointed in the wind noise of this vehicle I knew something had to be wrong Why would you make such a classy vehicle and forget about quality After taking it to the dealership three time we were told nothing is wrong with the vehicle that is just the quality of GMC
0,Run over curbs and your only clue will be the sound and the bump The high beltline and the huge poorly placed and conceived sideview mirrors make manuvering an athletic stretching event It has great handling on the road but my wife and I much prefered her S10 Blazers for everyday driving and drive thru windows We have had great service for the very few issues weve had
1,I just love this car Its like driving a Cadillac on a GMC budget Quiet powerful and handles like a sports car It stops on a dime corners better than any SUV Ive ever driven and sticks to the road like glue even on rainslicked highways With its high body placement I have no problem driving on construction sites and dont have to worry about driving through a heavily rocked area or updown a dirt embankment My last vehicle was a 2004 Buick Rainier This is the same GM body but it is miles ahead of the Rainier in every catagory If you want a truck with class and comfort this is your ride
0,I am so impressed with my 2007 SRX The interior is wonderful and very driver friendly The leather and wood grain look great I looked at a lot of midsized SUVs and sedansthis is the best of both worlds We got the 3rd row seating because we have 5 grandkids Even the older kids love the very back seat When they are not with us it folds down to a full size storage area The sunroof is incredible I will never be without OnStar or handsfree phone service Both are great security features The cars phone has worked in areas where my regular cell phone would not It cost more per minutebut when needed it is well worth it It is funny to have a car with its own phone 
1,This is my second Envoy my first was a 2002 It had massive engine problems at 2000 miles and after I totaled it from hitting a deer I got a new one I primarily got it for the high comfort great looks It has little problems that make it spend days at the shop It has also lost most of its value over the 5 months Ive owned it I would not buy another but I would rather buy an American car rather than some Honda or Toyota
0,I purchased a V8 AWD with the sport package The V6 SRX is more than adequate but for a little less gas mileage the V8 makes the SRX that much more enjoyable Here is a first for me after owning German American and Japanese luxury cars this is the first time I did not need to go back to the dealer to correct a minor or major problem You heard right no issues at all for the first 4 month and 4000 miles The SRX drives extremely well very responsive controlled ride very fast and the six speed shifts at the right times even wo electing to shift yourself Workmanship and the new interior are world class I am not easy to please but this is the best crossover out there and blows Lexus away
1,After driving a 98 Tahoe for 9 years with its poor brakes poor gas mileage and sloppy handling it has been a real pleasure to experience the performance of my 2007 Envoy Denali The 53 litre V8 out performs the 57 in my 98 by far and the gas mileage is at least 30 percent better around town I havent found anything I dont like about the car Well just one no glove box light
0,Large crossover Handles and drives like a car not a truck Magnaride suspension really helps with that and is well worth the  dollar1650 3rd seat mostly for kids but for the rare occaisions I need it it is perfect It stores in the floor at the push of a button
1,Compared Rendezvous Buicks new Acadia and TrailBlazer I was looking for smooth ride and a vehicle that felt like if I step on the gas I wasnt taxing the vehicle As soon as I test drove this I said this is it Traded a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder LE with 30000 miles dont miss it at all Tried some foreign models never felt like I had a solid car You must try this vehicle if you are looking for a SUV Not too big not too small My husband liked it so much he traded his 2006 Ford for a new GM Sierra We will keep these for a long time Both have the solid feel 40 somethings are looking for Paid about the same as low and mid end foreign vehicles Got better ride and quality
0,I absolutely love my SRX I looked at these for two years before finally taking the plunge with a 2007 V6 with the third row power folding seat I wasnt sure I really wanted an SUV since I had driven a luxury sedan for years but the transition was effortless My husband wanted me to get the Ecalade but I felt that was just too big but the SRX is perfect The ride is wonderful and I have no problem parking and turning like you can have with other large SUVs
1,You hear all the hype about GMC being Professional Grade dont believe it I purchased an 07 Envoy with a Nav System This Nav system is a waste of money It is DVD based like most but the one thing that GMC did that all other makersdecided not to do was to only allow the indash unit to accept one disc at a time For a  dollar2000 option dont waste your money if you want to Nav and listen to your CDs Get the 6disc in dash and buy a TomTom or Garvin that rides on the dash It is cheaper and better that way
0,Had an 05 SRX and thought I needed a bigger rig to hall the kids so I got the Yukon XL Denali and then I knew I missed the fun exillerating drive of the SRX So Im back Got the fully loaded V8 all the toys Rides like a dream corners like a sports car hauls the kids with fun Open sky with both roofs and AWD for the NH snow Black on Blackhead turning I think Cadillac missed the call to market this exciting crossover Fun to drive quality build upscale materials power to spare Youll love driving the V8 Now go out and get your Caddy SRX and take to the highway Its a fun sporty crossover
1,When I ordered this truckit was my 3rd GMCWhen it came off the truckI was there and thought WOWwhat a truckAnd then after 7 visits to the dealerand 20 different issues My latest problem will be the end of my GM problemsIt burns almost 2qts of oil in 1000 milesAnd GM says there not sure whyValvetrain noiseis also issueThey actualy asked me to do a oil consumtion testAnd if that isnt strange enoughnow they want my dealership to take it on a tripto do there own test
0,I replaced my BMW 325xi with the SRX V8 fairly fully loaded I wanted something fun sporty to drive yet that would have the space for both passengers and stuff for the growing family plus that I could use for visiting business customers The SRX which we recently got has really blown us away on all fronts Outstanding interior comfort and the driving experience for a car of this size is just a hair less dynamic than the BMW  quite amazing really Fuel economy is soso but I expected that At least it takes regular fuel so there is savings versus premium on most comparable vehicles This vehicle has the best of all worlds  comfort performance fun luxury and utility
1,I bought this truck brand new and have been sorry for it I had it in the shop like 10 times in the first 15 years I would really have to think hard before buying another GM product even GM customer reps did very little to help resolve my issues radio replaced remotes replaced one speaker blew out  now another has blown out  power steering unit replaced cross member bar repaired tie rods replaced motor mount replaced body mount replaced steering shaft serviced something in steering wheel broke and rear seat was unstitched when bought
0,We traded in an 04 CTS and opted for the larger SRX It really is an awesome vehicle The power is strong throughout all the gears If you didnt know it was a 6 cylinder you would think it was an 8 Great ride supportive seats The roof is fantastic Quiet ride Paint is top quality Anyone thinking of a mid size SUV ought to give this one a look Congrats to Cadillac Mileage is mediocre 4300 pounds is the reason
1,The gas consumption is terrible 14 mph not driving over 55 The tire monitoring system we can do without it The split seats are uncomfortable what was wrong with the bench seat With the new design there is no room behind the seat for any items The jack cannot be replaced to its position behind the passenger seat without being a contortionist The jack is totally inadequate I used it once and was fearful the truck would fall I found a scissor jack at a thrift to replace the factory jack The controls for the ac are way to exotic Dont need auto head lights I know when it dark the truck and controls are just too complicated I am one sorry dude for buying this I want my 94 GMC back
0,I love our new AWD V6 SRX It has the LuxuryPremium seat packages power pedals and is Silver with an Ebony interior It drives great and handles excellently when tossed through the corners Having driven it near its limits at a C  andD ride and drive last year left the feeling that it could be our new vehicle when our Envoy went back Who can beat the deal with the great finance rates and rebates I got this one for  dollar500 under invoice with just a phone call The fact that I bought from the biggest Cadillac dealer in the country might have had something to do with it I too am hitting mid15 mpg area in the city but on the highway straight cruising at 75 mph I was seeing 2527 mpg which is not bad for an AWD 4300 lb vehicle The hidden compartment above the glove box is terrific
1,I looked forward to this truck arriving and havent been disappointed I like everything about my truck Size handling performance I am in the process of customizing the truck and theres not a lot I have to do From four wheeling in the snow to pulling a large trailer to zipping down the highway this trucks got getup and control The only complaint I have is that the bottm half of the fuel tank disappears in a hurry but for a 53 its not all that bad So far Ive only experienced minor adjustments
0,One day after we got the SRX a snow storm hit The SRX got around in 6 snow without any problems The vehicle is very comfortable to drive It has much more interior room than the CTS we traded in Its gas mileage is not anywhere near the sticker numbers but it is improving
1,I previously owned an F150 that had no problems at all This was my first GM product When the honeymoon period wore off it lost its luster The heater fan quit in the dead of winter and the transmission needed to be worked on Both repairs left me with loaner vehicles for a long period of time Not convienent I guess my first GM experience hasnt sold on me
0,This is a great crossover We moved from a larger SUV to the SRX It drives like a car and still has most of the space of our larger SUV It is fun to drive
1,I purchased this truck new in late of 07 and loved the body style I have owned Chevrolet trucks before and this is my first GMC truck and I love it Sad to say a woman ran a red light four months ago and took my bumper and grille off it wasnt bad damage just cosmetic When the woman hit me at 55mph it felt like I hit a pot hole it I had to make sure I was hit This truck took a hit and kept on going the body and frame is so strong and well built I have it back now and I missed it very much I have the 48 engine and was cautious about the engine since my last truck had a 350 and was a powerhouse but the engine has really been great This truck is my favorite I plan to keep it a long time
0,This is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned and the visibility is great The interior upgrade for this year is very evident Im only getting about 16 mpg but the model is the AWD version so I expect it to be less Early on it leaked oil due to a faulty galley plug which was replaced under warranty Two rear fender well pieces became delaminateddiscolored and had to be replaced under warranty but I dont think the color Gold Mist was matched properly Im taking it to an independent body shop for a second opinion If I am wrong that will be the end of it If not it will be going back to the dealership
1,My only complaint with this truck is the transmission The transmission does not down shift right when you make low speed turns I have gotten as high as 21 mpg on the highway with a few mods I have installed cold air programmer and exhaust My daily driving average is about 16 12 mpg
0,With the V8 Northstar engine this is a fun vehicle to drive It has all the performance that one could ask for
1,Great looking truck on the exterior except cheap paint is used with lots of features but only averaging 16 mpg even on long highway trips Cheap interior all the way around  upholstery is the worst I have ever experienced in my life  it cant be cleaned with a vacuum and it is falling apart I feel gypped because previous GM trucks had good upholstery Carpeting is cheap Plastic interior is very cheap hard and actually discoloring  the truck is only 6 months old Even with all the problems  I still really like this truck Strange whirring noises independent of engine AC brakes or tires I have no idea what fan could be so odd sounding upon starting and while driving
0,This vehicle is absolutely the best vehicle I have ever ridden in Its fit and finish quality is first class The interior is very classy with the hand stitched leather dashboard and the real wood accents The ride comfort quietness handling and acceleration are all first rate The exterior styling is very distinctive and American It has lots of storage space The SRX includes all the amenities that one would expect from a premium car company
1,The only thing I dont like is fuel mileage Traded a 2002 in on this one and got a little better mileage Both had the same engine 4800 This is crew cab and the other one was a ext cab Bigger wheels and a little more weight may be part of the mileage problem Getting about 2 miles per gal less maybe it will improve with a few more miles
0,My wife and I just bought the 2007 SRX V8 last week We had been waiting until the new interior was introduced because we thought the old one looked cheap The new interior is absolutely FANTASTIC The use of hand stitched leather and real wood really makes the interior look classy We were in love with the exterior from day one This is an SUV that stands out from the rest and is very distinctively American We ordered the Magnetic Ride Control and this vehicle is absolutely the smoothest vehicle I have ever been in In addition it corners like a sports car is incredibly quiet but also provides the functionality of a SUV I am absolutely positive that the SRX is a superior vehicle to anything in its class
1,If you are looking for a truck save yourself a lot of time and go to directly to your GMC dealer Dont waste your energy going anywhere else including the import stores This is by far the best truck for the money best fit finish quality fuel economy performance Do I need to keep going If you have ever looked at a GM before this is nothing like you have seen
0,We love this vehicle and can really find nothing about which to complain The power is super the ride is comfortable it looks great It uses a bit more fuel than I would like but if you can afford a Cadillac you can afford the fuel Nothing about this car is cheap The Bose radio and XM satellite radio are the best My wife and I often just turn into the garage and listen to whats playing My one complaint is the manual could explain some of the buttons more thoroughly This car is the very best anyone could want
1,Bought truck approx 5 weeks ago Every aspect of the truck is as good if not better than I anticipated no buyers remorse whatsoever Great city or highway comfort and performance Needed upgrade to Crew Cab for growing family they love the new truck Cant wait to see the full effect of the 20mpg hwy mileage only have 1500 miles on truck so far Ive owned a 93 Toyota and a 88 GMC and this new one blows them away with quiet ride power great looks quality and comfort Highly recommend it Great job GMC keep it up
0,I ordered the new V8 Sport SRX with 20inch wheels and took delivery 111506 This Cadillac has everything I wanted in a new vehicle great looks smooth powerful acceleration comfortable ride and attractive well appointed interior with many driver convenience features Since my car is also my parttime office I wanted a vehicle in which I could enjoy time spent in it Now I prefer my moving office to my stationary one The Cadillac SRX is much more than just transportation
1,Test drove every truck out there including new Tundra with the 57 in reg cab They all fell short of the GMC in one way or another The interior was a big one most felt quite cheap and the comfort level of this new Sierra is amazing Handling is great ride is excellent good power and getting really good mileage in this reg cab with the 53 and AFM even though not broken in yet Im sure the smaller size of the truck makes a big difference in how often you are in V4 mode Lots of great standard features priced out about the same as the 06 I looked at last year
0,I have always like station wagons This is my first Cadillac My wife and I are very pleased with the product It is comfortable more than any wagon I have had previously It has plenty of spare power and handles easily I would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested in a superior vehicle
1,Sits high with the 17 tires and road visibility real good The great aspect of this truck is the comfort in the interior Plenty of room in front and back I like the seats folding down in the back for cargo room Gas mileage is not bad for the size truck GM out did others with this design The size can be a challenge I had to make more space in the garage area to get this vehicle inside It barely fit inside from back to front
0,I picked up my new 07 SRX on 102806 and it is a very nice ride I ordered one with the 51 surround sound and DVD player The ride is controlled and very quiet with power to spare The 6speed automatic transmission seems to be better on gas than my 06 XLR with same 320 horses and the five speed automatic
1,There are proscons to purchasing the last model year Pros Save thousands and all the bugs are worked out Cons You dont have the latest not always the greatest Thus far the Sierra has really surprised me The comfort of this truck is amazing This is one of the quietest vehicles I have owned Quieter than my Camrys Nissansand Hondas And its a truck
0,The 2007 Cadillac SRX is a great car It is fun to drive with its good acceleration and handling Its interior is nice for a family since it has leather on the seat areas and stronger materials on the doors The basic stereo is all we need and it sounds awesome
1,At first I didnt like the styling because it looks like a Ford I chose the 6L gasoline engine in the 2500HD to avoid active fuel management in the 53L engine With only occasional towing the gasoline motor is a good choice for acceleration with less maintainence The gas mileage is only slightly worse than I am used to with my Jeep Wrangler The brakes are really powerful once broken in Comfort on the open road is great I bought the vehicle on the internet at great price but it came without cruise control I asked the local dealer if he could add it and they said no On my Wrangler it was no problem because the wiring is already there but GM doesnt do this
0,I inherited my like new 07 STS this year and it is a pleasure to drive There are only a few squawks programming without the nav screen is complex and the drivers seat appears loose theres a TSB that addresses it and nitrogenfilled tires are a bit overboard Aside from those minor criticisms the car is an excellent performing car Its rakish looks are complemented by its terrific handling
1,I purchased my GMC a few weeks ago so far so good I had a Ford F350 powerstroke with 73 The GMC is small in the inside compared to the Ford The GMC has a lot better fuel mileage but seems to be too light to handle heavy trailers Its not short of power it will smoke my Ford easily My biggest complaint is lack of interior room GM still needs to do their homework on that The quality is not matched by Ford or Dodge in the interior and standard accessories but I think Ford is heavier duty than GM for all out abuse on the farm or on construction sites In about a year i can tell the truth because I know Ford can hold up Curious to see if GMC can
0,Like most people on this forum are stating this car looks great rides great preforms great stops great etc Mechanically this car looks and performs head and shoulders above its competition Where the STS falls short of everyone else is in the creature comforts that make a luxury car a luxury car GM went cheap and misses the mark on these items Bluetooth only certified to work on phones older then 2007 May work with newer ones but they are not 100 percent Bluetooth compliant See Suggested improvements below for more
1,traded in my 2001 yukon sle 4x4 170000 mi for the 2007 yukon sle 4x4 32000 mi I am a bit disappointed and wish for the old 2001 Miss the heated side mirrors and have a different rear end gear I get better highway mileage but worse towing mileage Have not had it in the mountainssnow yet the front end has a nasty bounce when going over speed bumps and on the highway over irregular road surfaces dealership cant find anything wrong
0,This is the first Caddy Ive ever ownedand I am truly impressed with everything about it I love the way it handles and the comfort of the ride I am spoiled now and will always look at Cadillacs when I need to buy my next car
1,I bought this vehicle in Sept of 06 and thought it was going to be the best purchase ever I have only had problems with this Yukon since the day I bought it Problems with the battery heater arm rests and more I was so disappointed as the vehicle looks sooo nice on the outside Inside is great lots of roombut poorly made with cheap parts Time to move onto something else
0,Had this STS for a month now and have to say it an awesome car Living in the north the AWD has shown that it can handle the winters here This car handles great and is very quiet and comfortable to drive Seems to be built solid and the V6 has enough power to keep you intrested and still provides an average of 18 mpg The 51 Bose stereo is the best I have ever heard in a car
1,I have a 2007 Yukon SLE that I really like EXCEPTI drive on some dirt roads and it is impossible to keep the dirt from packing onto the back window Driving in snow also results in snow PACKING on the rear window If you dont start the rear wiper early on you cant keep the snow off the window I feel it is a dangerous design and I am trading off my Yukon despite how much I like the darn thing for a vehicle with a different spoiler for lack of a better word above the rear window That is what causes the problem I had a 2003 Tahoe that didnt have this spoiler and the dirt and snow on the window was minimal Talk to a car wash place theyll tell you exactly what I am talking about
0,I have only had my STS for less than a month but so far I fall in love all over again every day I have had an H 2 for two years which I thought was luxurious until this Cadillac This car is easilly the favorite of anything I have or ever will have The ride is incredibly smooth like butter I cant imagine how the V8 STS could accelerate much faster than my V6 because it is FAST and the overall handling is to die for The XM radio and the OnStar are things I dont need but use often I think the pearl white White Diamond paint was the final selling point for me as it is stunning I bought my 07 brand new in 08 saved quite a bit doing it this way   and would definately reccomend
1,Its surprising how poorly GM designed the 2007 Yukon By now youd think that they would understand that its unacceptable to have panels and wipers falling off the the truck to the tune of several hundreds of dollars of unexpected expenses Interior packaging is just OK difficult to get kids in and out of the vehicle even a vehilce of this size
0,I picked up my 2007 STS with 5K miles about 3 weeks ago After owning a Lexus Infiniti Mercedes and BMW I think the STS presented the most value for the car This was my first American car in over 20 years What an improvement in design and quality I love the technolgy and comfort Finally nice job
1,I have had repeated difficulty with the electronics resulting in electric locks going uncontrollably up and down and the vehicle shutting down I was also disappointed in OnStar After purchasing turn x turn directions I learned that the sattellite was not working in my area They just kept my money until I brought it up after asking for directions and receiving the new of not having sattellite coverage in my area I tried made in the USA and I lived to regret it POOR JOB GM
0,This is my first American car in over 20 years I trade in cars every 3 years due to my business Driven Nissan Lexus Infiniti Jaguar and Mercedes I have to say this is STS was the best value for my money I got a lot more than what I get with any of the others including the Certified 6 year 100K warranty as my STS was a demo with 5K miles Finally nice job Cadillac with all the refinements technology ride etc
1,This is my 4th new GMC truck in as many years GMC has some work left to do on this one with some areas that greatly need improving The entire drivetrain needs refinement The engine has decent power but the transmission is horrible Compared to the Allison in my last diesel this 6 speed GM made transmission is junk It is not happy in any gear but reverse and is confused the rest of the time It is geared too tall Same with the flybywire throttle It is as unpredictable as the one in the ill famed Audi 5000S The cheap plastic on the interior is horrible It is the same poor quality stuff they put in all low end GMs Very bad for a  dollar55k SUV Never again
0,I have now driven this car for a sold year The car looks great and handles well There are some problems that you should not have with this price range I have noises in the power stearing The gas cover is cheap and is just spring loaded I get less than 145 miles a gallon in the city I do like the style and handleing There is somthing about a caddy that has a dual exhaust that is streamlined All n All this is not a  dollar54000 car This is more like a  dollar40000 car If you were to compare this to the Lexus or Benz in the same price range you might sway away from the Caddy but the Caddy have much better lease deals I was able to lease this luxury car for nothing down and  dollar599 a month
1,I had a 99 Denali then switched to the Envoy and Envoy XL for a few years When I saw the 07 Yukon I knew I had to have it My wife wouldnt let me get the Denalicost but I have enough features on the one I got so Im not complaining The big selling point was the fuel management system V8V4 auto switching I get the same MPG as I did with my V6 Envoy XL This the best Yukon yet I cant even imagine how nice the Denali must be
0,My search for a leftover 2007 STS V8 took some effort but it was definitely worth it I prefer the 2007 grill to the more enhanced 2008 version  clearly a matter of taste Previous car was a 2000 E320 I would say that the STS is in another league in terms of overall refinement The interior is absolutely beautiful  particularly in Cashmire I have not taken the time to figure out the navigation system but all other controls are user friendly The quality of materials is on par or superior to the Mercedes Aside from a Corvette this is the best American car on the road today
1,After six months of driving and 21000 miles I have gotten to know the service staff at the dealership on a firstname basis They have fixed loose moldings on the rear doors worked on air conditioner twice without the problem being fixed turned the front rotors and fixed a broken arm on a rear seat When not in shop it performs well Gas mileage is in the 21  22 mph on the Interstate It pulls a 19 foot bass boat with ease and is very comfortable Overall I am not dissatisfied but the little stuff is a pain
0,This is my 2nd STS I expected a lot of my new 07 STS and have been very pleased so far Cars I considered before buying my STS  all very nice but either too small or offered less value 1 Acura TL and RL 2 Lexus GS and IS 3 Infinity M35 4 Subaru Tribeca 5 Audi A6 6 Mercedes E Class 7 BMW 5 Series 8 Volvo S70 The 07 STS handles like a sports car with luxury feel exacly what I was looking for Its quick for a V6  I test drove the V6 and V8 and there was not a huge difference to justify the incremental cost I looked at a bunch of cars and the STS in my opinion gave me by far the best bang for the buck see favorite features below Very pleased so far
1,The Denali with the AutoRide suspension feels tight and has little body roll You get a 6speed tranny 380 hp 417 torque and every comfort feature imaginable for under 50k
0,Car is an automotive winner She blows the doors off the Mercedes Benz E class the Infinity M35 or the 535 series BMW in both performance and and good looks Full featured for far less
1,By far the best ever built Drives like my Benz Get it loaded and you wont want to get out of the vehicle Unbelieveable ride and power Find myself looking for excuses to drive
0,I am 60 years old and a car nut I have owned 5 BMW cars and a friend said to drive the STS I have not owned or leased an American car for 40 years I drove this car and fell in love with it I received an abundance of rebates and leased this car for 36 months with only paying taxes for 42000month GM sent me a 200000 off certificate as well The car handles smoothly I can feel the road The V6 is plenty powerful and I didnt lease based on the  dollar46000 MSRP The car is tight beautifully equipped and rides like a dream I have OnStar my own voice activated phone etc If GM could get people to drive this car they would buy it Kudos to General Motors for getting their act together
1,I have owned this for two weeks Day 1 went to start car in driveway wouldnt start Had to be towed Dead Battery new car Day 12 the wipers went off by themselves and stabilitrak light went off The wipers wouldnt stop Turned car off to get gas messages were gone Took to the dealer 24 codes had been thrown but not the two that happened They cant explain it its running fine now
0,The STS has won us over For the price looks convenience build quality gas mileage we are extremely pleased with this machine
1,I went back and forth for a month and a half between a Denali and Escalade decided after figuring the personal prop tax in VA payment   and DP diff and cost to insureI saved  dollar180 a monthand the Escalade didnt have the NAV or rear camera or Ipod jack built in only xenon and airconditioned seats were not I came out of an Escalade so the step back was hard but it was a great decision I bought a black on black every option for a great lease price I get all kinds of compliments the build quality is head and toes above previous models and the technology is great Performance is crazy for a 3 ton truck ride and handling are car like and visibility is much improved A and its American
0,Ive enjoyed owning my Cadillac STS  I can sum up my experience like this reliable luxury solid headturning quiet smooth fast beautiful graceful turns on a dime great stability and best of all my 66 husband fits comfortably
1,Great features Need to address the rear cargo floor area With the 3rd row seats removed the floor is not flat and very awkward to place groceries or other cargo on Transmission 6 speed is downshifting all the time
0,I just leased a 2007 Cadillac STS V6 all wheel drive This car is a blend of performance luxury and technology With the V6 you have enough power and all wheel drive should give me great control in the winter This is not your Fathers Cadilliac It has a smooth ride with enough power to keep your attention The interior is luxurious I chose this car over the BMW 5 series E350 Benz Lexus GS and Infiniti M45 I chose the STS because its luxury performance and lease incentives The sticker was  dollar52000 and I leased it for  dollar612 a month with nothing down This car competes with the others in its class too When I look at the US cars most of them are not worthy to compete in this class The STS is This is the new Caddy
1,Replaced a 2001 YukonXL with a 2007 Denali The quality of both has been great The 2007 has sideairbags stabilitrack and higher crash safety This is not a good tow vehicle on paper it looks great but the rear suspension is too squirmy  I think it is the air bags that level the load The steering is ambiguous A 34 ton YukonXL would have been a better choice
0,Ive owned an Audi a BMW and a Lexus None of those satisfy me like the STS Northstar It has lots of power the best handling sedan Ive driven PERFECT Audio by Bose great engine tone and luxurious appointments I drive nearly 80 miles every day so comfort and fun are important to me None of my previous luxury cars have held up well My Corvette is still my weekend car though I am thrilled with this car but when the time comes Id love to get an XLRV yeah I just need to save for 2 years D I suggest you stop looking after Cadillac No BMW Audi or Lexus will compare and I have experience with them all
1,Bought this Yukon XL 4WD 2007 model back in June 2008 from the dealer in Amman  Jordan It has a 16 inch standard rims with narrow 24575 wheels Unfortunately this SUV is the worst feel car that I ever drove You feel uncomfortable in the 1st row extremely in the 2nd and worst in the 3rd It feels like riding an open pickup truck and not at all like an SUV The suspension is poor rigid and when you ride over a bump the whole SUV shakes like a one rigid piece Overall a very bad experience that I will never repeat
0,This car is 30 grand cheaper than Mercedes and absolutely runs better You dont have a service engine light come on everyday like the German vehicles The 6 cylinder is nailing 197 mpg combined hard driving and is extremely quick off the line and very quiet We truly cannot believe how much we enjoy this car Seats performance Bose Audio and Wood grain are above expectations
1,This is a great family vehicle Love its style and comfort We got a good deal 10000 off msrp Only problem is a phantom rattle or vibration in front at low coasting speeds Dealer cant seem to figure it out Also we did not get leather so the seats are a terrible lint trap They collect everything from lint to hair Towing is great The fake chrome interior door handles are bad had to be replaced due to chipping At that price you think it would be cheaper to do it right the first time
0,The 2007 Cadillac STS is a wonderful car I see lots of reviews Until retirement I was a damage appraiser I know whats underneath and this car is just head and shoulders above the imports
1,Great truck With newborn twins and two older kids along with 2 dogs this truck fit our needs very well Was very happy with the truck until the 12000 mile service There is already a TSB If you get any knocking in the engine engine warning lights traction control or stabilitrack error messages go to your dealer Cylinder 3 was selfdestructing and they will not let me drive it due to safety concerns Will see how long a new engine takes and am concerned that the new one will have the same issues
0,Overall GM did a great job with this redesign The wife and kids love the interior Have the Rear DVD for the kids and I will say it is a godsend Ride is really good nice and smooth Decent fit and finish I think GM could have done better with the gas mileage I know this is a 6000lb truck and I expected poor economy but I am averaging 1113mpg regularly around town I hoped cruising the interstate in primarily V4 mode would help but alas 1618mpg on the highway Great utility in this truck just be aware that odds are you will get 15mpg on average and that gets worse with E85 fuel Other than that I love this truck but costs to drive are too high for me
1,This is an allround great vehicle except for a few minor things that are ruining the experience It has the worst high beams since my wifes Aerostar van a candle anyone electrical gremlins have surfaced  the headlights go out while driving and then mysteriously return later  dealer cant diagnose and OnStar cant find anything while idling the truck activated the windshield washers and emplied the tank problems with the rear view camera that were fixed with upgraded contacts Driven responsibly the fuel economy is on par with my 2005 AWD Yukon XL a bit worse in town and a bit better on the highway Tons of room inside yet remarkably easy to park in the city
0,I bought a gently used and fully loaded LTZ and love the truck Just came back from 2400 trip and was glad I took it Plenty of room for luggage in boxtrunk Felt safe on the road being higher up Could see great when driving in bad weather with too Handled well even at higher speeds Kids loved the DVD player Bought it because wanted a box to haul things and a size like a surburban Sharp looking truck Now wife wants one too No surprise on fuel economy 12 mpg city 18 hwy  65mph I live where theres alot of snow so the extra weight helps with traction much less rear slippage than a pickup
1,Bumper cracked from end to end after backing out of driveway over small mound of snow was told by owner of body shop that it wasnt our fault it was the fault of poor design of front bumper will always have this concern because front bumper acts like a huge scoop that allows accumulation and eventual breaking of 2 clips which are currently backordered more than likely they are in demand because of all the bumper repairs was told to strongly pursue issue because of possible chronic replacements GM will not assist unless brought to GM dealership at our expense for evaluation Will they risk alerting the customer of this design fault we think not WILL PURSUE THIS WITH ALL WEVE GOT GM FAILS
0,Thought itd be a good time for this At 50000mi my Av is doing well with a few problems This winter the 4WD started kicking out when the wheels slipped and dash read service 4WD Later this spring rear parking sensors quit Both computer glitches warranty fix Oil consumption a little high maybe a quart per 3000mi Builtin oil life monitor would let me go over 8000mi between changes All Ive read says this monitor is as accurate as can be so I run it to 10 percent life and change it Hwy MPG as high as 19 in warm weather Paint fit and finish interior leather holding up very well just wipe down those stylin aluminum wheels every car wash A darn good truck and Im not easy on it
1,I purchased the newly designed 2007 model Denali with all the options With winter here in Idaho the accumulation of 14 inch of ice on the rear bumper blocks the lift gate from opening With the automatic lift gate option it keeps trying to open until it completes its cycle with all of the grinding that makes you cringe There is no splash guard to keep the tires from throwing snow and ice on the running boards The build up of only a few inches does not allow the doors to open or it drags the bottom of the door When the snow melts on the roof it runs down between the door pillars and drops out the bottom and freezes on the running board keeping the door from opening or rubbing
0,Upgraded my Silverado to an Avalanche and so far no disappointments I love this truck Smooth on the highways and plenty of power A great looking truck with a luxury car feel
1,I purchased the Yukon XL to replace my minivan Expected gas economy worse than my minivan So far Im 1mpg better Increasing tires to 40psi and driving efficiently garners 185mpg city Havent had a road trip yet but I am looking forward to it Bigger safer and more fuel efficient than my old Montana Ill take two
0,This is the best car I owned so far The versatility of this vehicle is exceptional Great interior and exterior designs for work and fun I got it with the Z71 pkg special grill running boards sunroof DVDCAM DVD based Navigation which is not preferred towing kit and every things else Black color is very nice but too hot for S Florida The bed cover is great and you can keep things in it with no worries When the seats are down you have room to put drywall 4x8 and keep it enclosed This is amazing I was very happy with it and proud driving it but had to give it up because of fuel costs
1,I pull a 26foot trailer and when it comes to a hill you think your in a 4 cylinder GMC should not sell this as a tow unit
0,If youre looking to kill 2 birds with 1 stone there is no better choice As a homebuilder I need the functionlook of a truck on a jobsite but it cleans up so well that we use this same truck to go to church outings evenings out everywhere Ive racked up 66k miles in 25 years and all Ive done are oil changes whenever the light tells me to and changed a set of tires shouldve balanced them more often was told I average 46 hrsday in my truck when out and could not imagine a more comfy ride and interior At 61 and 250lbs it fits like a glove Fuel economy can be an issue if you have a heavy foot as I used to but even though I still drive aggressively I avg 16 mpgs city
1,We traded in a 2006 BMW 530i for our 2007 Yukon XL Denali we have infant twins My only complaints are some of the luxury aspects of the vehicle Some of the interior design is 2nd rate for the price dash board area between seats display etc It rides great at all speeds My wife was extremely nervous because of the size but now has no fears If you have a big family this is your car Plenty of space plenty of power plenty of quality For all that complain about gas mileagewhat do you expect The vehicle weighs 7000 lbs It is the safest for my family It carries my family with gearsorry minivans but I can pass cars with no problem at any highway with a loaded car
0,This truck is absolutely gorgeous so many compliments rivals that of my Corvette As far as mpg not bad for what you are driving Drives nice but I encourage all buyers to purchase air ride Makes your  dollar40000 vehicle ride like a  dollar40K should This is a big vehicle with lots of blind spots Get back up camera for sure Another problem to lower the mid gate you have to move both front seats up a lot Not even an option for long trips Seats arent as comfortable as I would like but maybe its just me Light in bed should be controlled by tailgate not courtesy lights I have had a few things that seem like they need replaced but I bought mine used so might just be driven rough I love it
1,Of course this Denalli is awesome in every way I thought our 03 Yukon was the best thing since sliced bread but the Denalli made it seem like a 2 for 1 deal at KIA But have you ever removed your third row seats If you dont have a chiropractor you better get one Why are these not folding flat yet It makes me cringe when we need the space Wheres the hood light Also a vehicle in this price range really should have air conditioned seats And last but not least as expected the stellar gas mileage Obviously OPEC subsidises these vehicles in order to keep profits up I mean this truck will outrun most sports cars on the road today but youll never pass a gas station
0,Went from a Ford Expedition to this and never looked back Rides better handles better and is way more comfortable even on long trips since I go to Hayward WI in summers and FL in winters and travel with 70 lb Golden Retriever and wife and plenty of junk in the back This baby offers best of both worlds from SUV to pickup If you want a little more styling go pay another  dollar20 grand for the Escalade version
1,I bought this vehicle for carrying multipassengers and for towing a boat It does both with style and ease The big engine option is worth it if you are going to tow but dont expect stellar gas mileage from this It does well for what it is Console with DVDNavigation gets a little busy and the illumination of the dials could be better After 7 hours of driving I am not beat like I was driving our Lexus This is a great blend of towing power and comfort
0,First brand new vehicle and first time owning a Chevy truck Few problems initially with only 1 recall for heated wipers which they did during oil change Unfortunately after rolling just 19k transmission crapped out I baby my truck so when pulling out in traffic the tranny goes Im not a happy camper Up to this point have been happy with my truck But this experience definitely leaves a sour taste Might not go back to Chevy
1,The vehicle performs very well Towing a travel trailer across the country I got 12 mpg which I thought was fine Solo it gets close to 20 Over 6000 miles it has used no oil and the computer says to change it at 15000 miles The fit and finish was a little disappointing I need to take it to the dealer to have the strip on the passenger side replaced as it is falling off The right rear wheel well also has a slight defect Other than the finish problems the vehicle performs very well The navigation system is very good and performs exceedingly well It got us out of several problems with detours The preprogammed trips are excellent
0,I have had this truck now for almost a year with 12k miles and I could not be happier I have had no problems with this vehicle at all and lover the styling and comfort as well as the versatility I am always being complemented on the truck it looks much more expensive than it really is I have added 22 chrome wheels chrome front and rear light accesories as well as on the back liftgate handle area I have the LTZ pretty much loaded with the rear camera and nav which is extremely helpful For anyone looking for an SUV that also doubles as a truck there is nothing that compares especially if you are looking for true 4 wheel drive This blows the socks off of the Honda Ridgeline
1,Purchased this car on 010207 to replace our 2001 Suburban LT 4x4 Demo with 1000 miles on it Immediately drove from SF Bay area to Lake Tahoe for a weeks vacation Remote start was unbelievable Start the car from the house 10 minutes later the car is warmed up heat on full heated seats on etc Such a pleasure Kids love the DVD with wireless headsets mom can listen to her music too Handles the mountain altitude extremely well  the 6speed automatic really shifts smoothly on the steep inclines Much better than the Burb Poor FM reception and distance Great XM radio but we need road conditions etc
0,I traded in a 1999 Chevy Silverado and I am very happy with the Avalanche Chevy has definitely began to compete in the truck arena with quality vehicles it was almost too late but sure glad they did it for the 2007 model year because I was leaning toward the Honda Ridgeline I was turned off with the 2006 models Chevys quality yes quality material and updated interior and exterior designs sold me Take one for a test drive see for yourself
1,Have had mine for a week Ive had two other Yukon XL Denalis with an 05 the last This one promises to be the best One major flaw and a safety issue is that you cannot see the instrument cluster in daylight Night viewing is fine Before buying check that out and ask the dealer to guarantee a fix The old Denalis had a builtin mud guards   and the 07 doesnt so you should consider adding that or the sides of your vehicle will be a mess With these two items fixed I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a BIG SUV to tow a trailer boat or just to haul a bunch of stuff andor people around in relative I didnt expect great mileage and that expectation was fullfilled
0,We just picked up our 07 LTZ So far its been absolutely wonderful Weve got every option but the Navrear cam Previously had a 00 Yukon and the new platform is by far superior Love the new interior very high quality materials no cheap plastic look that was common with GM for so long Weve been running only E85 because its almost  dollar060 cheaper here South Dakota than regular unleaded Were getting about 11mpg in town and 15 or so on the highway That compares to about 1418 with the Yukon on 10 percent Ethanol Im going to run a tank of 10 percent Ethanol next time to get an idea of how well the Active Fuel Management does So far cant tell when its in V4 vs V8 Been great
1,We just upgraded from our 05 Yukon to the 07 Yukon XL due to a new arrival in the family I was skeptical that there would be little to no difference in the actual ride quality but I am no longer skeptical This vehicle is hands down more comfortable than the previous models I wont purchase one with leather until GM can prove that it can install leather that doesnt wear so horribly Ours is an SLE but opted for the rear entertainment remote start and XM as well I appreciate that you load the DVD to be played in the front of the vehicle instead of the rear I must say that the ride rivals that of my parents 2005 Lexus LX470 Test drive one you will feel the difference
0,The 2007 Avalanche delivers the finishing touch for its unique featuresluxuryperformance and technology Truck lovers will situp and take notice at the design of this rugged tough looking vehicle Along with its powerful performance the comfort and luxury can make you forget your driving a truck But when you want or need truck features youll not be dissapointed The standard and optional features deliver a generous level of safety and technology that is sure to rival competitors all at a very reasonable price The 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche is truly an awesome driving experience It rises to take its place as one of Chevys Pinnacles in truck design
1,Mileage has been ok at 22 in town and 2729 highway Power is great with quick pickup and easy pull in mountains of Tennessee and Kentucky This is a Florida car with good ac in the summer Am disappointed with small stuff like a rattle that the dealer cant find  I think its the exhaust pipe the dealer installed automatic mirror needing replacement and the cubby hole door in the dash not staying closed Surprising for Honda
0,Most comfortable and easiest to handle Steering wheel has to be easiest Ive ever been behind as far as handling Ride is like a dream and Id recomened this Avalanche to anyone that wants to keep their truck and be happy
1,I purchased this car because I travel for work What a mistake The seats are very uncomfortable on long commutes and there is constant road and wind noise I would not recommend this car for anyone who travels for a living The ride is too stiff also I guess this is how Honda makes a separation with Acura I cannot wait to get another car This time I will do extensive research before I purchase based on reliability only
0,Excellent versatile vehicle Can haul full sheet of plywood with tailgate shut Excellent payload love the fuel management features Supurb interior and ingenious design with the mid gate and removeable rear window Truck drives like a car or hauls like a good truck should It does get a little cramped with the rear seats folded down You have to move the front seats forward pretty far to get the back seats to fold down all the way
1,I bought new in June 2007 Great gas mileage 2632mpg it depends on speed etc I dont like that the headlights are not automatic This is the first car that Ive owned in the last ten years that did not have auto headlights The seats are not comfortable after a while I have taken this car on a few road trips and my body hurts after a couple of hours Its great for my 30 mile work commute though I had to replace the brakes at 50k miles I had a blowout on one of the rear tires at about 40k I expect both of these things to happen on a car of this caliber Its not a luxury car but is dependable and does what I need
0,Purchased my Avalanche in late 2007 as a replacement for my 2000 Silverado Extended Cab I wasnt sold on the the previous years Avalanches as they appeared to be cheaply made My wife liked the Avalanche and convinced me to give up my practical pickup for a vehicle that would accomodate our 3 kids yet still offer the functionality that I required pickup bed Ive been more than pleasantly surprised It rides terrific I own a contracting business and tow a large boat The Avalanche hauls and tows large loads with no problem while maintaining considerable interior luxury I highly recommend the navigation system Additionally I recommend the DVD player if you have kids
1,Just drove home the 2007 Accord V6 and it is fantastic The V6 is better than my I30 V6 and nearly as good as the G35 This is my 3rd Accord had a 93 and 96 before I lost my mind and bought the 01 I30 which was a great value but current G35 and M are overpriced so I went back to Honda Looked at TSX several times and again not as good as the Accord V6 And did I mention the year end deals3K below costThanks Honda
0,I love the look of the car and the fact that I can go out to dinner with fricends and the next day toss lumber in the back That is what I liked most about this SUV But I have had issues with the Nav system and a loud popping noise that shoots through the speakers and you never know when but then the nav and dash systems blinks off and then comes back on for now
1,Wow I was strictly a V8 man before purchasing this V6 Hybrid beauty I get 35 to 38 mpg highway and around 25 in town Comfort style and great handling in this car I actually bought two 07 Honda Accords one for my wife 4cyl non hybrid and the 6cyl Hybrid for me She loves her Accord also  it gets 34mpg hwy Honda quality and workmanship throughout Too bad Honda has made the decision to discontinue the Accord as a Hybrid I really dont think they marketed the car that well I didnt know Honda built an Accord in Hybrid form until I saw one at the dealership
0,I had not planned on getting one at the time but I am sure glad that I did LTZ package is awesome wish I had the NavigationBackup CameraDVD package but no complaints Ive towed a utility trailer popup camper and full size camper in the Colorado mountains with no problems Sound system is great interior is comfortable engine is powerful utility aspect is wonderful and of course it looks great Yeah it uses some gas but you have to consider that before you buy it Im at 19000 miles right now and Id buy it all over again
1,Previous owner of a 98 EX coupe with 183K troublefree miles I hated to sell it but I needed 2 extra doors The 07 fits like a glove handles crisp and tight and gets great gas mileage Had to get used to a couple of things from my old Honda like the absence of the change drawer on the left but theres one in the center in front of the shifter The radio controls are a little more complex but having basic volume and channel buttons on the steering wheel are great An overall wellrounded and wellbalanced car Best of all no more timing belt I think the timing chain was introduced in 03 With the suggested improvements listed below this car would have no rival Coming in 08
0,Bought my 2007 Z71 Avalanche 1 year ago Have 18000  miles with not a single problem Truck has great smooth power and excellent fit and finish Rides extremely smooth even with Z71 package In construction and usually get a new truck every 6 months but plan to keep this one Very comfortable with well placed and logical controls Gas mileage averaging 148 over 18k of driving all in city Best all around vehicle out today
1,Car rides tightly smoothly great on winding roads Good engine power AT transmission a bit abrupt at stop and go slower speeds trying to find comfortable gearing Great rear seat room
0,I was pleasantly surprised at the quiet ride and the seats provide good support and comfort I have the rear end lock up on my 2wd Every so often Ill go off road when fishing but stick to trails Glad The OnStar is a great feature and I really like the XM radio
1,Among the five Accords and Civics weve owned this one is the most unHonda At freeway speeds the power train has a gear whine like an old bad differential It whines under load and is quiet when coasting So on the flat and level as the load goes on and off the whine flutters irritatingly The acceleration is uneven when shifting from first to second Over moderate undulations on the freeway the rear suspension feels loose like the boulevard ride on a big heavy GM sedan in the old days The gas mileage barely makes the Maroni numbers altho weve got less than 1000 miles on it The speed related power steering assists too much at freeway speed and not enough when parking
0,Bought the Avi in California drove it in desert with great comfort Moved to Colorado mountains with ABS Stabili trak and 4WD on 20 wheels you simply cannot get this vehicle stuck in the Colorado winter Much better comfort and feeling of safety and security than in my previous 2006 Avi Fuel economy is very acceptable for the size of the Avi E85 delivers almost same mpg as gasoline plenty of E85 in Colorado and at about a dollar a gallon less cost that gasoline the cost factor is impressive even with a slightly lower mpg Much better in winter in the Rockies than my neighbors Escalade with 2WD
1,I purchased a 2007 Honda Accord Coupe LX V6 based on Hondas reputation for reliability and the good looking coupe Its a strong car but have discovered quite a few issues 1 at 300 miles on the odometer something inside the dash started rattling loudly 2 when driving slowly 5  10 mph the automatic transmission keeps jerking with a noticeable thud up and down 3 the suspension is very rigid and you can feel all the bumps and 4 seats are a bit uncomfortable The jerky transmission makes me a bit worried that it will fail in a couple years
0,My best mileage around town to work is 17 The best Ive had on road 285 mi One way is 198 Use the cruise and keep your foot out of it I tow my 8000 lb Bobcat 200 miles road and get 132 nothing to complain about My pu only got 10 I will buy another Avalanche I drive it like its my Caddy and Im 64
1,This car reminds me of the quiet looking family sedans of the 1960s that housed serious power But with the Honda you get the addition of handling Cant tell you how many times we have lost this car in the parking lot It looks like every other 4 cyl LX model
0,So far my Av has been a great performer Looks terrific in Metallic Gray and 20 rims Locker rear end handles snow ice and mud very well even in 2WD Nicest roomiest rear seats this side of a Ram Megacab Cargo versatility is ridiculous stuffed it to the brim with drywall and even rolled out a sleeping bag and spent the night in it when no hotels could be found The ultimate highway cruiserlike a Cadillac The fuel consumption readout helps keep your driving style conservative The blind spots are big but the mirrors provide very good vision and the parking sensors are very accurate even on something like a skinny pole Im very pleased with my Av
1,Well this supposed to be nice car with navi and v6 Well the body is kinda weak gets dents easily paint chips and brake and tires arent so good for what I paid Even though it is Honda they should improve on those categories I bought Honda for quality but now their quality is getting poor The seat is kinda uncomfortable compare to TLS 2003 and compare to VOLVO T60 which I had Also one of my dim lights is not working
0,I love my Avalanche My wife was not sure but she loves every thing about it now I had a Chevy that would get 35 mpg on the highway but I traded mpg for how I feel after a long trip To maximize fuel economy it shows when you are in V8 mode or V4 mode and it will show you how much mpg you are getting By watching my mode I can get 21 mpg on the highway or 18 with the E85 fuel Plus after driving from Iowa to Texas and back again I felt like I drove accross town I wish I could afford one today for my wife
1,I really like my Accord SE 4cyl Its roomy gets great gas mileage looks sharp and drives a lot nicer then my 2002 Camry My Camry has a very soft Lincoln like ride while my Accord has a more sporty ride DONT BUY THE HONDA MUSIC LINK IPOD CONNECTOR Honda should not be selling this unit It expensive  dollar289 incinstall the functionality is useless cant use the iPod controls when its connected Cant wait to see the 2008 model
0,After owning just about every kind of suv car truck I purchased this from a friend and cannot wait to get behind the wheel each day Sold a 2007 Toyota Tacoma Sport and replaced it with this vehicle and would never go back LTZ equipment package 60 366 hp engine tops Get the factory navigation if you can
1,Love everything about the car The gas mileage is not panning out On highway best mileage so far has been 27 MPG On street stop and go I have gotten as low as 14 MPG
0,Traded in 2004 Z71 Tahoe Test drove 2008 LTZ but with 0 percent financing and on lot availability bought 2007 LS with the few options we really wanted Really liked both  ride is great impressive interior room Mileage is better than the old Tahoe and better than the 1520 rating getting about 17 around town and around 21 highway And it looks great It adjusts great for both my 51 wife and my 61 frame Have already used it to haul 8 lumber 12 trim and new oak doors  love the midgate Even my Mother who has always hated trucks as the good car has told my Dad that he could buy an Avalanche to replace their Buick next year
1,Although I am happy with my first Honda I feel they are somewhat overrated The Accord EXL V6 sedans ride is very firm and can be punishing on some road surfaces The paint has some orange peel and is very susceptible to stone chips and scratches particularly on the front edge of the hood Some of the ergonomics and features are quirky However its averaging 23 MPG in a daily commute and it looks great in Nighthawk Black Pearl
0,This is my first Avalanche LTZ and I love driving this truck This thing is loaded navigation dvd back up camera heated seat etcIt does everything you could ask for in a trucksuv Ride is smooth for its size Get a lot of compliments from friends and stranger For a truck 14  15mpg is great Chevy really stepped up with the new design inside and out Its luxury style without paying the Cadillac price
1,After driving a Mazda 6s for three years I purchased a Honda Accord EXL 5 sp manual with the 4 cylinder The Honda is not the drivers car the Mazda is however this car has better quality throughout After having the V6 in the Mazda I was concerned that I would not be satisfied with the 4 cyl in the Honda However I am very impressed with the Honda 4 cyl It has great torque and does a great job in this car
0,I have a loaded 07 LTZ that I traded the intial 02 Z71 for Loved the first one so much after 5 year and 92K miles I had to have the new one There are huge improvements to this GMT900 version in all areas including comfort accessories performance handling and fuel mileage The new Active Fuel Mgmt system gives 165 170 MPG City and 188204 Hwy It has retained most of the good things the original had with better features Still too pricey at a  dollar45K list
1,I just purchased a new 2007 Honda Accord I really didnt like the power of the engine It could have more torque and horsepower But overall I really like the 2007 Honda accord I like to drive it but still dont feel the power The smooth ride will give some a headache
0,Traded my 03 Z71 with 100000 and no problems and did not think the 07 could be better overallbut it is Ride is a lot better fuel economy better handling better features a lot better What a fantastic piece of equipment again This is the first time I have purchased the same vehicle for a second timefantastic
1,A good car all around for the family Nothing stands out negatively after a month of driving and 1000 miles The gas mileage for city driving is close to the sticker 235 although that is trying to be easy on the motor during breakin Performance is very good for a 4 cyl and handling seems solid The interior is comfortable and the controls are easy to operate though the automation of the environmental system is a little complicated If you just want to vent normally you have to check that the AC is off etc My only complaint is the road noise is more than I expected
0,Ive only owned this vehicle for a week but I can say that after driving the Nissan Titan and the Chevy Silverado the Suburban based Avalanche has the best finished interior and best ride of the three vehicles The 53L 327ci engine feels a bit undersized but the fuel economy is surprising so I have no complaints with performance It would be nice if the engine would idle in 4 cyl mode to further improve city mileage A 6 or 7 spd transmission would help bolster acceleration as well as mileage The column shifter somewhat obscures the sterio controls Seating is comfortable and the large console storage is a plus Steering wheel audio control functionality is better than in my AcuraNice
1,I only purchased this car 3 days ago and I really love it This is my 3rd new car in less then 2 years and I think I finally have found a great car I test drove Camry Milan Elantra I owned a 2006 Sonata did not like On my first gas fill up I got 27 mpg city Have not been on highway yet Am thrilled wgas mileage so far cant wait to take it on a trip to see what I get This is a great car the EX had the features I wanted the only add on was the Protection Package and I am going to add the autodimming mirror at a later time I highly recommend this car
0,Been a MoparFord guy all my life until now and am very pleased with my Avalanche LT It tows my boat better than the Ford I had and yet rides like a sedan Well appointed inside the family loves the room cup holders and power outlets Very glad to have seven airbags too safetywise Lots of storage room and the tonneau cover is easy to remove Plenty of spots to tie down a large load in the bed too Way to go GM
1,Previous vehicle was a 2003 Honda Accord and loved it so much was reluctant to trade it in as I was afraid the new model would not be as good That thought was gone forever once I drove the 07 It handles great seems to be quieter and the ride is luxurious Very very happy
0,This vehicle is perfect for everything we do We travel camp commute to work in comfort and just ride around town I can fit 5 grown men in the car and my girlfriend doesnt complain that its cold because she has the heated seats on I want to take this truck everywhere
1,I leased this car with 122 miles on it and at 800 miles I started hearing a loud popping noise coming from behind the driver I have had it at two Honda dealerships for a total of five times and was also assigned a Honda Rep out at their HQ in California The rep says Honda relies on their dealerships and the dealerships say there is nothing wrong It sounds like a piece of junk Honda is not taking ownership for this poorly build car I wouldnt buy or lease this car and for that matter considering the way Honda has handled this situation I wouldnt buy or lease a Honda again either
0,I find this truck to be reliable and fun to drive but that changed when the transmission went out Everyone one has no answer and I hope that this is not the beginning of more problems
1,Last October I was excited to buy this car because I trust Hondas quality Unfortunately it is not true One month after the purchase I feel that the transmission hesitates when accelerating Three months later I always hear a KNOCKING NOISE coming from the front of the DRIVER SIDE whenever I stop or lightly accelerate This made me very nervous Now it is even more trouble One day when I tried to break at a sharp turn at about 30 MPH I could feel that the break suddenly stuck for a very short time Does anybody have an idea This makes me very nervous I am considering trade in the car if the break keeps sticking when taking sharp turn
0,This is my first Avalanche after buying 5 new Silverado pickups Its a great versatile vehicle has near luxury car like ride with great styling and comfort
1,This is the 6th Honda Ive owned and the 2nd new accord I have everything from mechanical problems to RUST in a 4 year old car Very disappointed Toyota next buy
0,Chevrolet has hit upon something pretty special with this truck It is one great vehicle It can cruise to formal events and can easily transform into a work truck The mileage is pretty good considering it is a full size truckSuburban I was worried about the switching from 8cyl mode to 4cyl mode on the fly but that works superb and is inditinguisable to the driver
1,Was expecting all round goodness but was surprised and disappointed by this car Was not going to buy a new car but the presidents day sale made it all worthwhile I like sporty cars but this car does not know how to smother a sharp jolt Sends it right to your bone May be the 17 rims Steering is stubborn when you just want to make small corrections to your line The sunroof is so far back that most of the time you will not realize it is there Access to storage is not convenient you will have to snake your arm through obstacles and make awkward contortions to access any main pockets The rear view mirror blocks the sun visors movement Creaks and groans Plenty of blind spots
0,This truck is truly an awesome and versatile truck A little soft in the suspension but that can be changed easily Comfortable to ride in front seats or rear Easily fits 5 tall adults Beefy and stout when compared to most other fullsize trucks on the road Easy to drive for my wife but yet still enough power for my lead foot
1,I have had this since 07 August and this is my second accord and second review After driving it for more than 40k miles I am noticing some defects When its cold its harder to shift the 3rd gear since mine is a stick shift Also I hear some rattling noise in the front and and some noise under the stereo Breaks and the clutch is fine so far and regular oil changes are done at Honda Dealerships It has a great pickup when shifting gears since its a stick shift No matter what it is a great econobox even after 40k but wouldnt buy an accord again cos Im getting bored with this carBy the way 2 months after I bought the car I had to take it back to replace noisy drivers seat
0,We ordered our 2007 Avalanche specifically to tow our Outback travel trailer We equipped it with the optional 60L engine 410 rear end transmission oil cooler heavyduty 4L70E transmision and rearview camera  in other words set up to tow The Avalanche takes to the hills with confidence 95 percent of the time we use it as a comfortable family hauler The redesigned interior matches our previous Sequoia in comfort and thoughtfulness of design The drivetrain is not as smooth or refined as the Toyotas but GM is getting closer I can feel the 60L burble at idle while the Toyota 47L was virtually silent This is my firstever GM vehicle  and so far I have been pleased
1,I bought my Accord as a certified pre owned from a dealership and have put 15000 miles on it 30000 total on car Rotors are really useless had to resurface them even with gentle use Seats are very stiff and start hurting after couple of hours There are multiple rattles and noises from within the car and road noise is awfully loud I have to turn up the volume to listen to the stereo Fuel economy is average I get 26 highway and city combined Also there is no easy cheap way to connect iPodMP3 player to the stereo have to buy expensive adapter Overall driving is pleasurable better than Camry feels responsive   and agile but definitely not the best
0,I realize now that all of the reviews I read before purchasing are true The new Avalanche rides like a luxury car but it is a lumbering beast You would never guess that it has 300HP you really have to step on it to get it to go Averaging 16 milesgallon If you are looking for pep or gas mileage forget it If you are looking for luxury and versatility it is an awesome vehicle
1,Our 2007 Honda Accord EXL V6 is a great family sedan We purchased this when the 2008 model year change came out so we got a great deal I prefer the 2007 to the new Accords as the new ones are much too large in my opinion Build quality and conveniences are above average This car really approaches its luxury segment cousins Acura Lexus Infiniti but not quite The leather used seems a little leatheretteish and parts creak a bit on bumpy roadscold days Highway mileage is not so great I dont drive super aggressively but I have yet to exceed 24mpg when EPA sticker said 2029
0,This truck is a pleasure to drive Versatile comfortable on long trips and the quality is excellent I have had zero problems rattles or any other issues with this truck Being a woman I like the way it sits up so you get a better view of the road I will definetly buy another one
1,18 months after purchasing our 2007 Accord LX the frontend began vibrating during braking We took the car in being that it was still under warranty and were told that the rotors needed to be turnedthe brake pads were fine Of course the rotors are not covered under the warranty I have been told by the dealership including the general manager that it is not uncommon for rotors to need turning within 2 years or 30000 miles That is absurd especially given the manner in which the car has been driven It is obvious that Honda used inferior quality rotors on this vehicle I wonder what other parts are defective
0,I traded in my 2005 Avalanche and this is a much improved vehicle The front suspension is much improved and no longer pops and shakes like the older body style The inside is much nicer and quieter too Rear backup sensors are a must as rear visibility is terrible
1,The O7 for my wife is the second in this series of Accord I have an O4 that is leaving for a TL Love the car Obviously with the 04 as well as multiple Accords previously we knew what to expect Only regret is not getting the navigation systemwife chose the V6 over that but I had to get her a Garmin Nuvi660 for Christmas
0,This is my 46th Chevrolet that I have owned Options WoW loaded to the max Smooth driving and handling Power to weight ratio in the drain I have driven 11000 miles in 5 months Window sticker advertises 16 city 21 highway the best I have acheived is 119 dealer now tell me thats normal Today while driving on a bumpy road at appr25 mph both side airbags deployed Not sure how this is going to work out but I am going to try and go back to a crew cab 1500 Z71 Chevy truck I have had 11 repairs with this Avalanche and I have lost faith in it This is my first regretable Chevrolet purchase I have loved the Vettes and trucks that I have owned The floorboard creaks when turning also
1,2006   and 7 sedan owners check your dash I had to have the glove box replaced because it was not aligned properly and made a noise The old one and the new one both have a dimple or sink mark in them Youll also see one on the lower portion of the dashboard on the drivers side Honda says that sink marks are usually hidden by the graining but not on this dashboard Regarding the question of replacing it with another dashboard it will have the same type of sink mark so replacement is not recommended So basically they got junk from their source and were stuck with it Another unsightly area is the pass side airbag it looks like a sticker was there then removed and left a mark
0,The Avalanche is fun to drive A definite head turner The dash layout is easy to use and very nice looking much more so than other crew cab trucks If you are getting this truck definitely get the leather seats and back up camera The midgate is very easy to use with no learning curve However you will be spending more money at the pump
1,This is my fourth Honda Accord since 2002 Had a 2002 6 cylinder coupe loved it but hated the auto Got a 2003 6 cylinder Sedan wauto hated the car suspension was the worse The 2004 Sedan w4 cylinder 5 speed totally built in Japan was awesome 100000 miles in 2 years no problems except for tires This was corrected w Bridgestone LSVs BUT the 2007 6 cylinder w 6 speed is totally great Honda did it all with this car Will change tires soon Stock Michelins are lame Would put this car against Lexus IS 250 Cadillac CTS Volvo ACURA TSX and more Thanks for listening Honda you hit a home run with this car Got great deal as dealer did not want the 6 speed on the lot TOO BAD
0,The vehicle has numerous areas of vibrations and rattles The gauges are almost unreadable during daylight driving I did not opt for backup sensors or camera These features should be made standard because of the poor rear vision Gas consumption is about what was advertised The seating is very comfortable The lighting in the rear bed should be improved
1,Ride is uncomfortable Dangerously pulls to the right either not aligned properly or there is a manufacturing defect gas mileage is less than I got on a Buick LeSabre Very disappointed in this car Would not recommend it to anyone
0,I just traded in my 02 Suburban for an 07 Avalanche Z71 4x4 I love this truck The exhaust and engine sound great The new interior and dash cluster really looks up to date and then some The engine is very responsive and shifts very smooth Fit and finish inside and out is fantastic The new rack and pinion steering feels much better than my 02 Suburban The aluminum control arms and coil over suspension absorbs road shock from bumps and holes very well The overall feel and look of this truck is awesome GM has hit a home run with there new line of full size trucks
1,I have the very mixed feelings about this car I like how it drives The steering is precise cornering perfect acceleration great The transmission is fine when accelerating but jerky in slow driving It upshifts when it is not really needed Inside everything is located logically easy to use CD player and FM are good but XM is not I dont like climate control because AC and heating are used together for defogging and windshield vents are too noisy There are intermittent rattles that come in disappear and come back again Suspension of Accord is sporty bumpy In overall I am not completely happy with my Accord I feel like I drive an oldie car but I still rate it high
0,This is a great truck I thought about getting a regular pickup but instead went with the Avalanche and am so glad I did The midgate is an amazing and useful feature Its incredibly versatile The abiltiy to lock the bed is priceless Definitely the best truck Ive driven and with out a doubt most practical for day to day use As for gas mileage though it is kind of a hog the active fuel management makes a huge difference and the instant fuel economy display is a great way to help alter your driving to conserve fuel
1,I would still be driving my 2003 Camry with 4 cylinder and automatic if the gal with the cell phone had stayed in her own lane I would be driving a 2007 Camry to replace the 2003 if Toyota had not lowered the headroom by almost an inch 2003 was the first Camry that fit my long torso Honda has a good reputation and the 2007 Accord has headroom equal to the old Camry so it seemed like a no brainer but I was wrong The Honda isnt even close to the Toyota in so many ways Unfortunately the test drive wasnt long enough for me to pick up on everything The front seats are way too stiff and narrowhave to drive with wallet out of pants Highway mileage is 23 mpg less than Camry
0,Ive never ridden in a truck more comfortable than this its apleasure to drive forgiving I drove on road trip to Austin from Mississippi not tiring and the dvd to boot Thanks Chevy A real winner
1,After a dealer buy back of my 2005 Dodge Magnum Hemi I was looking forward to getting the Accord It was a come down from 340 HP to 244 but well worth the trade Great materials and built quality Classy interior good acceleration for a V6 not as good as the 07 Camry but the styling is cleaner and built quality better I was concerned about the many recent Toyota recalls Also to get comparable equipment the Camry would have been thousands more I cant wait for the redo in 2008 Hope the styling will be a little more radical with keyless remote push button start and a few more horsepower
0,This is my second Avalanche My 04 Z66 was fantastic and after looking at the others I decided to go back to the dealer and purchase a tarted up 07 with sunroof This is a great truck Heated leather seats Bose radio 22 Wheels improved steering and brakes Whats not to like It looks even better with the factory chrome wheels and running boards I knew what to expect with the mileage My family will love going on vacation in this awesome rig
1,I have had this car since late August and I love it I will start first with the engine and trans They claim it has 244 hp and I have no reason to doubt Performance is quite peppy for this class with the 6spd The internal design is great except for 2 things First there is no Aux input for regular MP3 players I dont have an IPod so their IPod adapter is worthless forcing me to buy a  dollar100 Blitzsafe aux adapter Next the Deck shows the auto climate control on it so if you replace the deck you cant see the temp you set Ride is comfortable and quiet not Toyota quiet better then Detroits offerings handles corners quite nice Lastly is look I love it some dont
0,I traded in my 2004 Avalanche for 2007 LT3 I pulled my 6500lb travel trailer without any problems and had plenty of power With my 04 it seemed like it was always between gears Not the case with 07 The gas mileage has also been much better 193 You feel no difference when the active fuel management kicks in I am very happy with my purchase
1,The range of the keyless entry and lack of horn or otheer audible single makes it hard to locate your car in a giant parking lot the range of the feature is approx 10 feet If you have to be that close you do not need to hear the horn you have already located the carthe the voice command system for other features is also poor
0,This is my first domestic vehicle This truck has wonderful fit and finish and has appoinments similar to those you mind find in European cars The power is impressive though it seems a bit sluggish from a stoplight or in a passing lane The poor MPG is well documented I drove it from LA to Monteray roughly 400 miles at 75 with the cruise controland still only averaged 14mpg All of the luxury features are nice and made well Bluetooth is a feature this vehicle is missing and GM has no real excuse for not equipping it on a  dollar50 truck
1,For the middle of the road for features the SE brings a lot to the table for a reasonable cost The ride is a little stiffer than other models but the sport 17in 50series tires take some of the blame but pay back dividends in cornering
0,Exactly what I wanted with only minor improvements suggested Beautiful truck virtually silent driving love versatility and comfort The 2 tone seats look great The seat warmers are a must for tired muscles and bones Over 16 mpg in town Handles and rides much betterr than my 02 Suburban The dashboard is well set up and easy to see
1,I have owned 6 previous Accords 95 98 99 01 02 and 04 and this is by far the best The perfect build quality reflects that it is in the last year of this body style I tried buying an 06 civic prior to this purchase but found many design flaws and rattles and poor grade interior materials to be disappointing I am sticking to Accords Accords represent the best compromise between cost fuel economy practicality and quality If you are driving in an urban setting there is not my difference in fuel mileage between a Civic and an Accord 28 mpg vs 25 mpg
0,just bought this car and like it a lot Great interior and the front of the car is very nice looking A lot of room inside A truck bed a hitch and a hard tonneau cover its got everything you need Free year of OnStar Good car overall
1,This is my second review I now have 31k miles on my Accord This has been an outstanding value for me I do about 20K business miles per year in the Accord If I am not in a rush I try to cruise at 65 MPH on the highway and when I do I get about 32 mpg The car has been totally without problems so far All Ive done for maintenance is oil changes Third gear is a minor irritation as it will pop out of gear when the car is cold and Im not careful with the shift action The engine is a work of art with a high redline and plenty of torque I added an iPod connection and fog lights to the original package TL sway bars and auto dimming mirror are next Great car
0,I have nothing but good things to say about the Avalanche It rides great handles perfect the stereo has great sound and bass and the fuel mileage is better than I expected
1,Everything on this car works as advertised I get about 25 mpg driving mostly in the city All the goodies work including the voice activation system The AC went bad at 3 months and it took two dealers four tries to fix it but all under warranty My 8th Honda and Ill continue to buy as long as the quality holds up I find it very comfortable but I do very little long distance driving as some of the other reviewers The tires are a bit noisy but I think that is a Michelin problem Ill try another brand when the time comes The OEM tires have 22000 miles and still look new
0,The 2007 Avalanche LTZ is a wonderful vehicle Quite rides beautifully and the fit and finish are excellent Towed a 5500lb trailer last hunting season without effort The options on the LTZ are terrific but its kind of hard viewing the rear entertainment system from the front seat The vehicle has 7000 miles and has yet to see the dealership service bay This is my second vehicle with satellite navigation and the touch screen is easy to use
1,Rides great ridiculous mpg I get 32 mpg to work and back Going 70 mph on cruise I get 38  Nice smooth clutch unlike the old flimsy Honda clutches The only thing wrong with the stereo is that you need to replace the speakers and it will sound great for under  dollar100 If it ever gets wrecked Ill be safe and Ill get another one just not the new body
0,The 07 LTZ Avalanche is like driving a luxury car Very smooth and handles great through the Minnesota blizzards Very safe The back seat has lots of leg room Kids love the wireless DVD player It is a great looking truck I try to burn E85 as much as possible The 8 cylinder to 4 is a joke It only drops to the 4 when you are going down hill or coasting My mileage is 1450 on regular gas and 1200 on E85 The engineers should look at the competion like Tundra and Rideline they could build the best of the best Look at my suggested improvements below and simple things like mudflaps reciever hitch plug a business card slot put a K   and N filter in as stock A quicker engine would be great
1,I have owned my Accord for 2 years and I have not had any trouble with it The four cylinder engine performs very well I am glad I did not get the six The only shortcoming I have found is in the rain a cracked window allows a lot of water to drip in It usually ends up on the window controls
0,I owned a 2002 Avalanche which was flawless and a great vehicle It is hard to believe that the 2007 is even better in every respect The heated leather seats now have two stages seat cushion and seat back Nice touch The two tone seats in the Z71 are awesome The truck negotiates curves very well no longer as top heavy as the 2002 It seems to hug the road  no easy feat for such a big vehicle The seat to steering wheel ratio is now perfect for a 64 person The tailgate is now much lighter and it locks automatically The 6 changer with MP3 is great as well The speakers are in the wrong place and do provide a stereo sound when the seat is all the way back
1,This is my second accord They are good cars Never had reliability issues but I only drive hem for a couple years lease Only complaint with this 2007 is the seats Im 61 225 lbs and I find the seats very uncomfortable after a couple hours on a road trip I never mentioned this complaint to my wife She took the car on a 5 hour road trip and when she returned she complained that the seats are uncomfortable I had to laugh because she is 57 115 lbs My lease is up in a couple months I will be taking a break from Honda and looking for a bigger vehicle with more comfort
0,I traded in a 2001 Durango for my Avalanche One of the best moves that I have made dealing with vehicles The ride is very smooth seats are comfortable and the Bose stereo system is fantastic I have had the Avalanche for only two weeks but I just had to give Chevrolet a big pat on the back for making this great truck
1,Had the car a year Loved the economical operation the room the dash layout and the BEST navigation system on the market HOWEVER the drivers seat was terribly uncomfortable on the upper back and the leather seats were hard I actually hated to drive the car because of the seat comfort Resisted selling the car but when the front brake rotors has to be resurfaces three times due to warping under warranty i decided to sell it Very mixed emotions when selling however in retrospect it was the only choice I HATED the seats
0,Outside paint is not bad exept the plastic grill paint flaking off Too much plastic for the sun to bleach on the back Keeps the back to black company afloat with the amount I have to use on it The inside is nice and plentey of room but a bit plasticy Seats are comfortable on a long drive Sound system is great It has plenty of power to pull stuff with and without wheels on it Motor cuts out over 95mph Four wheel drive works well although a bit noisy Nice ride for a truck I use a 4x4 for what its built for on rough terrain and in the mountains So far its doing well but a few more cross land trips will tell This is my 8th truck in nearly as may years I wore the others out
1,I had a 93 Accord and loved it Then I bought this 2007 top of the line EXL V6 and am not really happy with it First the rattlingvibrating when car is cold Wind noise is lower than my 93 Accord but still could be improved Then the disappointing fuel economy  25 mpg Then the interior The dash board seems to have 20 pieces put together and each has a different shade of blackgrey The center console door below the radio broke and wont pushlock anymore
0,We ordered our LTZ with everything we wanted We love the ride and room An option we ordered on it is power retractable steps We thought this would be a neat option to have Were we wrong There are no splash guards to fit with the power retractable steps Which for us since we live in Wyoming means snow slush mud etc is splashed all up on the side of our truck We contacted Chevy and were basically told thats the way it and there wasnt anything that can be done about it When we discussed our dissatifaction with the dealer he tried to sell me  dollar1200 fender flares and the extra paint protection Beware if you think you want this option on your next Avalanche
1,Very comfortable family car even for long trips Great front seats OK rear handles and performs like a sports sedan Zero maintenance issues except for a little window rattle Average about 25 Mpg in mixed cityhwy driving and 3235 Mpg for trips  6365 mph Economy drops with a heavy foot or above 65 Mph Stereo speakers were awful had to upgrade on aftermarket Would have preferred the 4 cyl5 M but not available with stability control
0,I bought the Z71 4WD package and was a bit hesitant as to how the ride would be All my fears are gone the ride is perfect onoff road Smooth highway driving yet just the right amount of stiffness for some moderate off roading This is the perfect ride for a combination of on highway and moderate off road capabilities I got the 410 gears with the 53 engine and find it has plenty of power with nothing in tow The Z71 2 tone interior with brushed metal trim is definitely a plus Gas mileage will be 1315 mph unless you drive a lot of flat freeway The 8 cyl to 4 cyl switchover is seamless Light throttle on level or downhill keeps it in 4 cyl modegauge shows 48 cyl operating status
1,Ive had my V6 EXL coupe for 2 years now 3 yr lease This is a great car as reliable as it gets Maybe a little boring but arent all Hondas Very quick for a Honda Looks great but no wow factor No worries driving this thing around
0,I have had this 07 LTZ Avalanche for 3 days now and cannot find any faults Chevy definitely did it right with this vehicle The versatility is great the appointments are beyond what I was shopping for but I can really get used to these heated seats The ride is very civilized for a vehicle this big I definitely love the look without the plastic body cladding from the earlier Avs If you are contemplating an SUV purchase you need to do yourself a favor and drive an Avalanche it just may sway your decision It did mine
1,I traded in my truck in order to get better gas mileage I have not been disappointed at all I average 27 mpg for city and 31 mpg on the highway And believe me that I am hard on vehicles taking corners at higher speeds than one should speeding etc This car has been nothing but impressive from my standpoint I have had no issues with it and it has over 24000 miles
0,Been with the dealership for almost a year I brought home all sorts of vehicles from small Chevy cars to the Colorado pickup Came to notice all the sales managers picked the Av for their demo vehicles and got really used to driving one on errands for work I get to drive Escalades and all sorts of luxury vehicles but it was the Avalanche that made the most sense It has a true blend of luxury and refinement with a heavy mix of utilitarian comforts Not sure that Ill ever go back to driving a sedan again
1,I purchased this vehicle because all the reports said Honda and Toyota have the best crash rating and best gas mileage I am very disappointed I do all city driving and Im getting between 17 and 19 in the city The service dept ran a test for me but their road test was a combo of city and highway The test gave me a rating of 205 All the reports said I would get 2123 in the city and 31 on the highway I got better gas mileage on my 6 cylinder Nissan In addition to the gas problem the car tires are louder than usual I had it checked out and apparently thats just how they are I am an unhappy consumer
0,Went to the dealer and drove a fully loaded 2007 Silverado Classic and also the 2007 Avalanche No comparison the ride was extremely smooth and with included and removable lockable cover ease of conversion to 8 truck bed as well as Active Fuel Management idles to 4 cylinders on the highway  it was a no brainer Would be nice to have more cab storage but couldnt have gotten a better buy for the money Getting 18mpg in town and 20 on the highway
1,We bought Honda after having small intermittent problems with our Saab 9 5 Oh boy we were wrong about this value jump I just trusted to BS reviews of majority of people who drove Fords and GM in the past Although some can say Saab is another GM product it was quite impressive for something based on Opel chassis Anyhow here is a short list of Honda quality problems 1 Rattle in both front door attributable to TSB in Feb 2008 Service News Article 2 Shaking scraping and pulsating front brakes fixed under warranty  warped front rotors 3 Tires out balance fixed under warranty flatspotting is something I will have to live with on this car 4 Scratched cheap plastic panels
0,This vehicle is awesome Drove it to Colorado in the 06 blizzard It handled like a Caddilac I am from Florida and drove it through ice and snow with no slipping or sliding Passed other 4x4s stuck or in the ditch Great job Chevy Love the part time 4cyl to 8 cyl option My teen daughter loves the sound system I owned a Dodge 4x4 but will never drive anything else but an Avalanche I recommend this vehicle to someone who enjoys a comfortable quiet solid ride
1,"1 The car doesnt seem to stop skids  when brakes applied over road bumps Its a little frightening when it does that No problem driving in the winter though may be because I drive slowly 
2 2007 model accord doesnt has a auxiliary port"
0,Absolutely love it Purchased with every option except the power retractable BRS running boards Used it the first week to haul shelving with 8 particle boards Interior fit and finish is superb and is really beyond anything Chevy has had to date Backup camera is a great option Havent needed the heated windshield washer yet but the side mirror defrosters have come in handy The locking storage wells on the bed sides are a great idea and very pratical The bed cover is easy to remove and install suprisingly light and tight fitting Left the truck out during a steady rain for six hours and no water leaked into the truck bed Very quiet and smooth on the road
1,Outstanding quality sedan that got a little over 30 mpg with tailwind doing about 85 mph on 350 mile trip However going into the tailwind dropped mileage down to 26 mpg We also did a 1500 mile round trip for  dollar130 in gas during first of May 2008 It feels so good to NOT send so much money to the middle east
0,Went looking at Silverado Classic but after test drives it was too good to pass up Much better in every way compared to the Colorado Crew Cab we traded in Ride was smooth and quieter at highway speeds Turning performance and radius is better with less body lean Fuel economy is good averaging 15 city and 20 highway just like the estimates The interior is well layed out with easy to read guages The steering wheel audio and cruise controls are excellent features Visibility is good front and sides but rear visibility is poor due to the tailgate height the rear camera would be a nice feature to have Overall a great move up from the Colorado wife and I both love this truck
1,I have had my 2007 Accord for almost 10 months now and have 23000 Miles on it I love the car but it leaves more power to be desired in the low rpm My gfs 08 Civic seems more peppy and feels quicker in the low ranges I do not abuse my car and have had all services done by a certified Honda dealer Recently I have had trouble with the brakes Clunking when applied at low speeds I also hear a clunk sometimes when making low speed turns but not in curves Overall I am very happy with the car I average 34 mpg more than double my truck This is a highway car even though most people will probably use it as a city car If I had more city driving to do I would buy the Civic
0,This truck absolutely is a head turner I get compliments all the time A coworker has a previous model and he loves my new and improved model Very quiet cabin strong engine very tight fittinglooking panels inside and out The black color just makes the truck look that much better The premium cloth seats are very comfortable midgate design very handy Ive got the L1 model2wheel drive w sunroof DVD player premium sound and woodgrain interior Oh check out the climate control on this thing looks importish Man is this a truck or a luxury sedan Chevy hit a home run with this one
1,Not exactly a sports car or a family car The V4 doesnt accelerate as fast as the V6 would but the engine is more powerful when you are already at high speeds A little too bulky compared to original Hondas
0,The ride is unbelievable So quiet and smooth I have owned several Lexus sedans and would equate it much the same
1,I hated it but i had to get rid of my Accord The drivers seat is so uncomfortable  my back hurt all the time  I was miserable This is in spite if the fact I have teh EXL with all power seat adjustments Additionally for the second time in 1 year my brakes rotors had to be turned and new brake pads installed Honda would not replace the rotors so I know that since they have been turned twice its only a short time until the vibration when braking returns Beware of Honda Seats
0,This is my 2nd Avalanche I owned a 2003 and it was nice but the 2007 is the best vehicle I have ever owned I will buy another Avalanche in a couple of years I wish it got better gas mileage but what do you expect with a 6000 lb vehicle All my friends tell me it rides better than their cars
1,This is my 4th Accord my first was a 1983 model This is definitely not the nimble Accord that I remember The Accord has grown to from a compact to a midsize The Accord suffers from the bigger is better American car syndrome Older Accords were definitely economy cars not bloated family sedans The 07 model suffers from some surprising for Honda design flaws The rear doors are oddly designed forcing you to move far away when opening the door The trunk is large but difficult to access with a small opening And no outside temperature gauge or fuel economy monitor standard on most VWs If youre looking for a fuel saving efficient small car the Accords not for you
0,Really enjoy this vehicle The car looks stunning Interior is nice Fabric picks up lots of things Interior needs a little top mount center console like our mini vans The exterior paint doesnt feel quite as nice as other cars Ive owned The ride is incredible So smooth Power is great Flexiblity is awesome Easy to convert
1,Overall the car has been mechanically reliable and runs great but with only 7000 miles its not saying much The body integrity is horrible The drivers door flexes creaks and rattles in a way thats unacceptable for a  dollar20000 new car Ive been to the dealer 3 times to fix it to no avail However if the windows cracked open slightly the rattle almost disapears
0,Chevy did their homework on this truck It is a pleasure to drive The appearence of the vehicle and handling is great My wife said it was too big Now she loves it Thanks GM
1,bottomlin 2007 Honda Accord EXL disappoints Compared to the competition it hold its ground but compared to previous Accords it fails misebrably i have owned a 2002 Honda Accord and a 2006 Toyota Camry in addtion to this 2007 Honda Accord EXL Things I dont like The interior material is cheap and subpar the 2002 accord has superior interior craftsmanship 2007 accord has black leather interior the leather is of the cheapest quality it emits a fould odor like bad body odourthe pillar and roof are light grey while the rest of the car is black it is supposed to be black uniformly but the dashboard is dark black plastic while the vinyl dashboard is grey no black uniformity
0,Should have bought a 4dr truck but the ride and handling was what won me over Acceleration is awesome Sheet metal fit is excellent but the paint has some dirt and craters The Active Fuel Management system is a joke 15 to 17 MPG on highway but will get 20 driving in the 45 MPH range
1,I have owned 5 different Honda Accord models The 2007 EXLV6 is a big disappointment I have experienced an unusual vibration that shakes the steering wheel dash and mirrors whenever the car sits parked for periods longer than 8 hours The dealership states its caused by the tires flat spotting Michelin somewhat agrees and were good enough to swap out the OEM tires with another model of Michelin Pilot tires and they also vibrate So I had them install Yokohama Avid V4s and guess whatthey also do the same thing I called Honda Corporate and they claim this is how the Accord was engineered to ride and that I should get used to itneedless to say Ill be trading very soon
0,Ive been driving a Dodge for 10 years When I first looked at this vehicle I couldnt wait to drive it Im very happy with my decision to purchase this vehicle
1,I bought my Honda Accord a month ago I am not very happy with the acceleration I get I believe the VTEC engine takes time to respond especially at the lower gears I drove my car for the first month only in city several lights  and traffic and got very bad mileage of 1819 compared to the advertised 24 mpg Have been driving without hard braking and use of much air conditioning or heat I was expecting atleast 2122 Very disappointed Not sure if I was handed the last bad piece they had
0,I had my mind set on a F150 until my wife conviced me to drive the 2007 Avalanche This is the most flexible and comfortable truck I have ever driven It looks great and really works like a truck I highly recommend that you drive it But be careful once you do you will not settle for anything else
1,We have about 65 kms on it First off paint quality is garbage the hatch has been repainted once already because of rust around the license plate trim The car is full of rock chips my sisters 05 Civic had the same paint issues Had the rear diff fluid changed 3 times at 3 diff Honda dealerships as a precautionary service They refuse to admit there is a problem RIDICULOUS Still makes a noise Rear pads and rotors replaced at 45kms Sometimes the car wont even crank over on the first try My 94 Accord winter beater has 300kms and has never had any serious issues Honda better wake up and do something fast because they are losing very loyal customers They lost us Time for a Subaru
0,This is without doubt the most practical vehicle Ive ever purchased The new exterior and interior are a huge leap forward for GM from the old model
1,I bought this car for the long haul What Honda fails to tell anyone is they installed a faulty rear differential and rear suspension and that is why the tires wear out by 20000 miles Dealerships and main office refuse to fix this problem and your complaints fall on deaf ears Im sorry to say the problem still exists in the newer models as well Im dumping this car asap and will NEVER own another Honda again
0,Got my Avalanche on the 4th of July Looking to get a deal on a 2006 but looked inside a 2007 and was swayed I have Ebony leather interior and it is stunning The woodgrain dash makes you think youre in the Escalade It handles suberbly and has good acceleration The electronics are amazing and I even got a Verizon line for my in car phone I have been looking at the Avs for a while and am glad I waited
1,Great little SUV looks could be improved with front fairing wraparound bumper available in Europe Not good if you need instant response from engine one time I stepped on the gas and it seemed to take a second or two before it responded if that is a safety feature its the most dangerous safety feature on any car but you get a lot of stuff for the money
0,Just picked up and drove 500 miles rountrip to New York Simply put it was a great ride Did not miss the 04 Vette convertible for the weekend The Active Fuel Management worked I got better numbers then the other review However cruse control is out or it will sit in v8 mode iPod quality was flawless sunroof was not noisy I was also very happy with the build quality Handling was fine for long windy thin roads from NYVTNH
1,I had a 2004 Honda CRV loved it but it rode rough Bought a 2007 and it was a much better ride but I have had problems with it Initially I was having problems with it starting The worst thing is it keeps wearing the tires out I was told by Honda it was in the rear differential I am on my 3rd set of tires at 50 000 miles Hondas solutionpay them almost  dollar1000 for new tires The main customer service representative was very rude and discourteous I will never buy another Honda car and will never recommend it to any of my friends again
0,had this for appx 2 yearsno problemsget 45 mpg highway mpg if kept under 65 miles per hour its not a perfect car but what can you buy new for  dollar8995oo if you know what your doing you can modify this car and improve your mpg
1,I traded my 2001 for this and the change is like night and day the new model is much less trucky looking and feeling and has a much quieter more carlike ride The gas mileage over my old 5 speed standard is better with not quite a month of very mixed driving the mpg is around 27 and an early highway trip hit 29 mpg The CRV hugs the road better and feels less skittish than the old model in sharp turns there is a fair amount of thump and bump over uneven pavement but still a big improvement I was waiting for the new model to come out before trading and it was well worth the wait
0,Our Aveo has 63000 miles We purchased it as a small reliable car for our son who is in college The car isnt what was promised The radio comes on when the weather is damp or when it rains The airbag sensor is on and one corner of the airbag cover came off We have had problems with the horn blowing and the interior lights The recall concerning the fuel pump running in a front end collision has us concerned too After 4 calls GMC is finally working with us We will not buy another one
1,EPA 23 to 27 Was that measured while going straight down hill Combined freeway and street driving is 19 mpg and that was with the cruise control while on the freeway Hitting reset after tanking up then driving 10 miles in town displayed 15 MPG about the same as my 4200 pound VW Vanagon and not even close to a 2001 C280 Mercedes 6 or a BMW 325 6 cyl both German cars get from 25 to 34 mpg on the freeway This reminds me it did get 27 mpg on the freeway but that ended when the first hill was approached then engine shifted and spun up to 5000 rpm and the MPG display crashed to the low teens Sorry Honda but this is no gas miser it guzzles
0,I bought a 2007 Aveo 5 door hatch back LS with automatic trans and air conditioning for my 16 year old daughter That was 2 and a half years and 30000 miles ago Its been a great little car  No problems at all and gets great gas mileage This was the perfect car for my daughter to learn how to drive Its easy to drive has great visibility and very good safety features like side impact air bags with good crash test ratings I guy at work has the same car but with a manual transmission and he swears he is getting 40 MPG  What do people expect from a  dollar12000 car  Its a great value
1,I have only had the car for less than a month and I have filled up at  dollar40  5 times so far My RT to and from work miles is 60 per day I filled up on a Sunday night drove to work commuter lot 27 miles away and return on Monday missed Tuesday and Wednesday and I am already at 12 tank I must go back to the dealer I am not getting even 16 miles to the gallon something must be wrong Tested with no air windows closed sunroof closed and at about 60 miles per hour and its like the gas is just leaking out somewhere Dont buy this car if you have to commute
0,I like this car It was cheap I wanted something inexpensive that was good on gas mileage and reliable Paid  dollar8100 out the door No air conditioner but it has a lot of good features that years ago would have been considered an upgrade Very reliable and so cute
1,I traded in my 05 LX for this car Love the new styling I read through most of these postings and I cant figure out it people are driving the same car I am as I am not experiencing any of this negativity with my car I just drove from Dallas to Nashville and averaged 287 mpg Drive the speed limit and youll see a big difference Road noise My 05 was much louder I miss the picnic table but what can you do Its a great car
0,I have found this a fun replacement for my 10 year old Elantra It has great pick up and better than advertised mileage This was a nice surprise because I bought it mainly for the price and lower insurance cost But as a tall person I fit better in this than in any of the comparable cars I tried out
1,Most of our driving is in a suburban area of Florida We get about 24mpg compared to the Honda van that we traded in that got 1516 mpg Our highway mileage is about 30 mpg The engine makes a buzzing sound when driving around town but it disappears at higher speeds on the interstates We wanted a 4 cyl for economy and did not like the Toyota RAV with a spare tire mounted on the back The Hyundai Santa Fe does not get as many mpg and we did not like the red color choice We added backup sensors and an auto dimming rear view mirror Dashboard is attractive with instant mpg readout and other info However the CRV is not as comfortable as our van was on long trips
0,For the price that I paid this car was a bargain I know its for transportation but this car is incredibly fun to drive Ive put over 8000 mi on it so far and Ive found it to be very comfortable even for 8 hour drives It also has been averaging 32mpg on my way from Boston to DC so Ive also been saving up to 80 dollars round trip which is incredible All in all it has lots of space room for 5 reasonably comfortable its great on gas and it gets you place to place with a 100000mi warranty for 11000 Money well spent
1,Loved this car when we first picked it up after driving a couple of 10 year plus old cars But with some time behind the wheel the CRV does have some faults Seats are uncomfortable very noisy cheap interior materials tire monitor light that comes on when its cold out and try rolling down the back windows at highway speed terrible wind rumble noise Performance and reliability should be good and of course the safety factor All in all a good car but not one to fall in love with
0,This car does what you expect it to do  save money at the pump for a reasonably priced car I owned it for 31500 miles almost 2 yearsbefore I crashed it My only complaint was that the front tires wore down after 22000 miles and the seats could be more comfortable Other than that the car pays for itself by laughing at gas pumps Bought it as a commuter car going 60 miles a day and never got less than 26 mpg city Highway got 3233 mpg easy I crashed it recently and the front collapsed well like an accordian and I walked away without a scratchI am 63 tall and fit well inside Solid car for the price Trunk is bighold traction button puts car into lower gear for torque traction
1,Pros Ride handling navigation and fuel economy Before buying car I thought power is not enough on the highway but with little bit of acceleration you have the power you want I am not a sort of fast driver so power is more than enough for me The car handles very smoothly and it is comfortable Road noise is like other good car I cant understand why some people are talking about it Interier is really nice all the buttons on the steering lightup when head lights on
0,I have the 4 door sedan Never had a problem Took the car over from my daughter who moved to Chicago and didnt need a car It would have never have been a car I would have bought It tuned out to be a very pleasant suprise The fuel mileage has been great and the room inside is unbelivable We had 5 adults in the car and I am 64 I put really good tires on it and it runs at 80 mph on the highway with no problem Easy to park I take it from Detroit to Chicago twice a month 45 hour drive and its comfortable I wouldnt want to take it across the country but Im old and like big cars Great car for the money 3 of my neighbors have bought them since I got mine
1,This is the most efficient vehicle ive yet owned Great MPG and requires only regular gas and is an SUV at that Nice turning radius and maneuverablilty but a little too much braking pressure is needed to stop Pick up is adequate Love the nitro gas tires Wish the armrests were independently adjustible as I recline more than most others do while driving dont worry not so much that Ill sleep The armrest is stationary so it rises to a more obtuse angle which means more awkward contact with the steering wheel despite wheel telescoping and tilting Love the car so far and my only wish other than the above is that the driver seat be multipowered the EXL be powered
0,I once had a Ford Escort but that was a while ago I drive 48 miles 1 way to work and drive on the coast of Califonia Speed limit 65 I work early so no one on the road and I drive 60 mph Nice ride to and from work getting 38 mpg It will be my 14yr old daughters in 2 yrs and she loves it Big change from my Suzuki XL7 which my college son drives now
1,I moved up from an 06 Civic which I loved It was hard to leave it at the dealership I will be moving to the top of a hill on about 3 miles of uphill dirtmudsnow and wanted something higher off the road and AWD As sad as I was to leave my fun Civic 10 miles down the road I knew I had done the right thing Im a little nervous about going from my excellent fuel economy to something a little more costly But in my first 300 miles Ive averaged 29 mpg I love the mpg guage too You can easily see where you could improve driving habits
0,I purchased my brand new black LT 4 door with all options except sunroof leather and steering wheel audio controls I checked around and it was the least expensive car with the options I wanted I needed a more fuel economical car being that I commute 150 miles round trip a day for four days My 11 mpg highway Ford Explorer V8 All Wheel Drive was killing me at the pump I still love my truck I put the car to the test as soon as I got it I had a custom made tow hitch installed to pull a mini tear drop cargo trailer and drove to Houston Texas She was loaded with 3 adults and pulling a loaded mini trailer She didnt miss a beat Mind you the car is cheesy You get what you pay for
1,Pros Ride handling XM navigation looks comfort Cons No automatic headlights Driving experience I was afraid that I might be making a mistake by not buying a 6 cyl vehicle such as the Toyota RAV4 which was my other choice My fears vanished when I drove this car out of the showroom and on to the highway The engine provides easy acceleration and plenty of power The car handles beautifully turns on a dime offers great visuals and is fun to drive I do not find road noise as described in other opinions to be an issue at all I find the cabin very quiet Comfort and convenience This car is unbelievably comfortable offers plenty of storage compartments
0,I work in construction and drive in the dirt every day My work is all over Southern California This is a well put together car When I first bought and it was clean I took wife and friends out to dinner several times Lots of interior room Now my car is constantly dirty so I only use for work I get 27 mpg with AC running and mixed driving During winter I get about 30 with mixed driving Interior is functional Good ground clearance Very happy and recommend
1,First I must say I was treated very well by Honda Morristown in TN The reviews are dead on This is a great SUV More power would be great but I would not sacrifice mileage for it Change holder and lighted vanity mirrors would be nice as would Home linkbut I have to look very hard to find something I do not like about this SUV Drive one youll see what I mean
0,Just got a night work shift so I can catch the bus now after driving days for three months Everything I expect from a  dollar10000 car with a  dollar2000 rebate and another  dollar1000 from charging groceries on my GM mastercard credit card points This Korean made car has a 16 liter engine to handle the load from the AC Since the Special Value doesnt have AC it has a lot of power I drive 95 percent freeway and get 37 MPG Same as a Cavalier with a larger motor Seating is OK Not plush What else can I say about a basic car Will buy another one in three years
1,I recently purchased a 2007 black on black EXL AWD model with navigation I picked it up on the day of a recent snowstorm and driving home from work I knew I had made the right decision I felt extremely safe I owned a VW Golf previously and was worried Id miss driving a manual Thats not the case as the CRV has great pick up for a 4cyl The handling is great as well A good guy friend drove it on the highway the other evening and was amazed at how it hugged the turns going at speeds of 75 The navigation system is user friendly and I like the voice recognition though its been a little quirky so far It can take two tries for it to hear your voice correctly
0,I bought my 07 Aveo in October 4649 Miles and tagged at  dollar11000 The vehicle does really good in city driving but leaves something to be desired at highway speeds I own the manual transmission and had to upgrade with an aftermarket intake just to feel like I was moving faster then a stagecoach All in all the car is fairly stable once you reach your goal speed as long as it isnt windy but takes a long time to accelerate even when you lean on the higher RPMs And it would be a good car for the price if you dont care about looks or horses thanks to the the MPG and dependability factor But thats all it has going for it to be honest My opinion is buy another vehicle like the Cobalt
1,Overall its a great suv however Ive had two problems The TPMS light went on two weeks after my purchase A more serious problem occurred last week and again today The front passenger side door has locked and wont open no matter what I do I cant open it from the outside with the remote or from the inside with the handle Today the back hatch locked and wont open Im taking it in tomorrow to the dealership for repairs This isnt what I expected from Honda
0,I am a social worker for the Commonwealth of KY and cover 13 counties of my region I have driven my Aveo over 45000 miles in less than a year over mountainous roads gravel twolane black top and four lane highways My Aveo has done excellent I paid less than  dollar14000 for a fully loaded red beauty with sliding sky roof air auto   and alarm It has been flawless I even hit a 100lb deer at 60 MPH and only damaged the hood   and grille It took the licking and I never had to park it but drove it every day since
1,At first I liked my CRV but as time went by I dont like it anymore Poor gas mileage and the noise from the engine is so annoying every time I accelerate By the way who designed the 2nd row seat I thought they are folded and flat like the other SUVs but they are not They just tumbles and should be hung by a hook I cant deliver a long item like a bookshelf etc The exterior design is so boring It was OK first but now it seems like its just too plain Seems like have seen it before somewhere
0,I bought this based on Chevys reputation At 4000 miles the generator and fuse box fried At 30000 the AC went and the dealer seems unable to locate another one When they find one they are going to have to special order seals The front end will not stay aligned and the car is too noisy especially in a wind The standard transmission feels like it is grinding The car is roomy and fun to drive but it is not well built My suggestion is to look at other subcompacts
1,After a long wait we purchased the newly redesigned 2007 CRV We are thrilled with everything about this car The turning radius is amazing The interior is extremely roomy and very well made The leather cleans up great The liftgate now opens up and not to the side so you can be parked inside a garage and open it with no problems The cargo area has a dual decker shelf that can be removed We love this little car
0,There is plenty of room in the front although the seats could be more comfortable for longer legged people The styling is similar to many others on the road now and can be made to look pretty sporty The worst drawback is the mileage I drive 40 mises a day35 of it no the freeway and it averages 31 MPG Not too good for a 16 liter four cylinder with almost no horsepower I bought it thinking it would be alot like the Geo Metro only bigger The Metro was quickerand got half again more mileage Boy do I miss it
1,This is my first Honda and SUV and I would buy it all over again in a second There is nothing about this vehicle that I dont like I bought the LX 2WD model about 1 month ago and let me tell you even though it is the base model Honda proved that they still care about my comfort and most of all mine and my childrens safety When I bought it I did not like how the door locks worked I would have to push my unlock button to get my kids out of the back seat But  My husband read the manual and found that this can be changed I have 5 different options of how I want my doors to lock and 3 options for unlock HOW COOL IS THAT Buy This car you wont be sorry I LOVE IT 
0,I bought this car mainly for the fuel economy 16L 4cyl 5A 2530 We were so happy until15000 miles and bang major repair in shop for a week now waiting for parts in drive traincontrol arm This is a major disappointment The car is light in the high winds Should have bought the Toyota Corolla for 2k more
1,My car has 65K miles on it and it wont start The dealer is telling me that it needs a new engine I had a Honda Civic before this and never any problems I am so upset The warranty only covers up to 60K miles so I am just over I made a complaint with Honda and we will see what happens But buyer beware only 60K miles on the engine and mine died at 65K I am still in shock and I have a  dollar16K loan to deal with now
0,This was my first new car and I have not been disappointed It is practical in terms of price but very nicely designed as well It is a small vehicle which is perfect for fitting into small parking spaces but inside it doesnt feel cramped Additionally Chevrolet offers a great warranty which I havent had to use yet but it good to know it is available if needed
1,having tested Lexus Toyota Volkswagen Subaru   and Volvo this little Honda dollar for dollar seems a wonderful buy took it for a ride in the Poconos it performed very well no its not a corvette but it runs on regular gas and is comfortable for the family and it seems well built with thoughtful extras not electronic junk that might not last for 100k miles the rear seat configurations have been well thought out with plenty of room in the back
0,I have come to love driving it but it lacks acceleration and the miles per gallon are not that great I estimate that I get maybe 15mpg as oppose to the 26 to 32 that I have seen posted on the sticker The head room is great as for the leg room which can become an issue with passengers in the back I like the handling around corners and how smooth the ride is All in all Ive grown to love the cars qualities as well as its downsides
1,How does Honda keep building the perfect auto This is my sixth HondaAcura and I am completely happy This is my first CRV Its the jack of all trades vehicle I have a Karaoke business so I had to give up my Tsx for something with room for my equipment I was worried that I would not like another auto as much No worries Its quite fun to drive The interior feels upscale and the exterior has character I also test drove the Rav but dont like the rear door or the spare tire hanging off the back In conclusion if you are in the market for a small Suv you wont go wrong with this jewel
0,We just got our Aveo in December I used it for a business conferance to Lake Geroge  350 miles across southern NY I set the cruise at 70 for most of the trip Im a big fellow  270  and I felt the car was pretty peppy Lots of head room and body room And considering I averaged 34 mpg I think the cars a good deal The dealer sold the car to us for just under 12000 including rebates All we added was cruise control We only have three thousand miles on it but so far it runs like a champ By the by I had good winter tires installed at purchased  along with extra rims The car handles very well in heavy snow and on ice with those tires
1,The rear Differential broke 2 times within 2 weeks and 700 miles on the car The power steering is jittery They also installed the ski rack on wrong and The bike rack is too high on the car to even put a bike up there This car is nothing but problems and poor design Also the extended warranty has about 3 pages of what it doesnt cover and only 1 paragraph of what it does cover and maybe when you will use the  dollar1000 dollar warranty it may cover a radio now if youre lucky When I got my car back from the dealer it seems like the 4wd doesnt even work
0,Very nice car for the money I was totally surprised at the interior design fit and finish layout and features loaded into my 07 Aveo LT I switched out a few things and customized the car like two tone black and tan leather seats The factory only offers tan leather a little too much Gets good gas mileage has plenty of space and really no complaints I even went back to the dealer just to price some parts to see the cost and the parts are inexpensive
1,Ok Ive only had my 07 CRV EX for one day but I thoroughly researched several others Toyota RAV4 and Hyundai Santa Fe and Tucson and just fell in love with this car The dealerships around me sell the cars before the even reach the lot or within 2 days of receiving I went 2 12 hrs away but had a selection to choose fromand they came down about  dollar1500 from MSRP I got the green tea EX 2WD and love it The only thing I dont like is the fold and tumble seats as opposed to lay flat seats I was highly considering the RAV4 but hate the tire on the back and not willing to pay  dollar4000 more for the limited with no tire on back Honda also has better resale value and slightly better gas
0,Best deal on basic transportation hands down Drove out of the dealership with a brand new Aveo for  dollar7250 Granted this included a  dollar2K GM Card rebate but without it I would have gotten it for  dollar8250 a price including TTL Performance is adequate lots of room and no power lockswindows that will break in a few years anyways Great GM warranty Build quality is very good Engine is a bit weak youll need to downshift to make it up a steep hill Gas mileage is good not stellar Appreciate the sideimpact airbags For the price its unbeatable Lots of 2007s still on dealer lots if you look
1,I am not sure if its me or the car itself I have driven my Mazda 626 for 9 years now and I never thought I heard other vehicles passing when cruising on a high way at 65mph But with this new CRV I could hear every car that I pass and the ones that pass by me I also think the roadwind noise is more Thats my only complaint The vehicle feels otherwise very crisp and comfort The noise is heard only on some highways If the pavement is a newly done one the noise is not bad I think the insulation by the car bosy and the window mirrors are of poor quality I really expected a nice noise free ride
0,Wanted a solid commuter with modern options and liked the look of the newly redesigned Aveo No doubt this is a small car but it does feel pretty spacious on the inside I got the LT with leatherette interior and it is definitely a cut above your average domestic The car feels solid and is easy to drive my only real concern is high winds on the interstate Car feels like it might simply get carried up up and away Also longterm quality is a possible issue but I guess Ill just have to see on that one
1,Ive always been a jeep owner for 12 years This is my first Honda and I love it I cant believe how roomy it is We didnt sacrifice space with this smaller SUV
0,I traded a 2005 Cobalt for this car In spite of the smaller size it is more comfortable but it doesnt have the driver information center like the cobalt I had got used to being able to teel the fuel economey and the outside temperature It also has a ridiculous power lock system that can only be locked with a key when one is leaving the car The power is adequate and it is quite roomy
1,The seats are uncomfortable handling and ride are poor I am having problems with the rear differential In the rain the when the front wheels lose traction the rear wheels suddenly kick in and the car jerks This is very disconcerting not a well designed AWD system
0,I have a new apreation for econo cars after buying this exceptional example of Chevrolets restyled import Well worth the price While true i had more than my share of problems from the start First a cracked windshild three days after I drove it off the lot replaced then a headlamp fogged up from holding moisturereplaced lose brake caliperrepairedrear view mirror mount fell offreplaced oil pump started leaking after 15K replacedsqueeking swaybar bushings after 25Kreplaced clunking front suspensionstill an isue After all this you might think i would be bitter but I just love driving this car I like the looks i like the handling and I love the MPG at 3239
1,Bought the car 2 days ago today was the first time on our lousy Hwy 101 in Santa Rosa Ca BUT  wherever you drive this car if the pavement is grooved usually a concrete road or if there are a lot of cracks running the direction of travel this car will be unstable Its like the rear wheels are loose its annoying I think its unsafe when you have many lanes of travel and its hard to keep the CRV in its own lane I travel this road all the time my other vehicles do not act this way And  all the Honda service department says its the tires and nothing can be done about it Great when I get sideswiped by another vehicle then what Blame the tires 
0,I came into the Aveo because my full sized truck was guzzling too much gas I wanted an inexpensive commuter I ended up with a pretty upscale for an Aveo 4 dr LT and its much more car than I expected Its smooth on the highway and comfortable and has many features you wouldnt normally expect to find in this price range like side airbags The sound system is nice with the MP3 changer and the steering wheel controls are good too I went to the dealership just looking but the price was too good to pass up after I saw how much car I could get for the money
1,I recently bought an LX 2wd and its a feature packed little SUV for a great price I looked at several compact SUVs and while I like many of them I discovered that many of them just didnt feel very solid The CRV may not be the cheapest but at this point I think its probably a best buy over the longhaul
0,I run a service center for a dealer and I am very familiar with cars I bought American because I am always able to get 250k  out of all my cars It wasnt until recently that I needed to put my GMC truck to bed and get an import I looked at Toyota Nissan great cars Mazda Honda etc I finally picked the 2007 Chevy Aveo because of price comfort and gas mileage However I am not getting anywhere near 37mpg as my sticker suggested Believe me I understand driving habbits but this has nothing to do with it I drive all freeway miles with no AC on at no more than 70mph and the best milage I get is 301mpg Yes I also tryed going under 70mph and I only got max 321 mpg
1,I am very impressed with the handling of my new 2007 CRV I had to swerve to miss a skunk last night and all I could think after the maneuver was wow I would not have expected this kind of handling from an SUV Very little sway or leaning into turns and is surprisingly quiet too The engine provides adequate acceleration
0,I have owned my little Aveo for almost 8 months I have over 28K on the car right now no problems excellent gas mil avg 35mpg Its the little things that make this car really worth buying Its the lumbar support the rubber on the knobs on the interior the power everything the antenna integrated into the rear window the easy to work on engine compartment the well placed cruise control buttons the mp3 jack the six disc changer spacious truck for such a little car the head room in the interior This car was made to be the perfect commuter vehicle It is just one of the best buys you can make add all the stuff and throw in the rabate and 0 percent that I got on it and its a steal
1,Purchase the 2007 CRV because of the new styling The vehicle has not disappointed me There are a few things that I wish it include Automatic head lights Rear seats that folded flat Overall a great car We were driving a full size SUV that was fully equipped There are some bells and whistles we miss
0,I am very pleased Gas mileage is 36 on hwy but 26 in the cityStop and go The car is very comfortable for me even though I am a larger male
1,I have only owned my 2007 CRV for 500 miles so this is still a very young affair However it has been everything I hoped for and more Very quite ride excellent MPG good view I had heard folks talk about blind spot s but I think the view from windows andor mirrors is great
0,I have owned Aveo 5 now for 2 weeks I chose this vehicle over the honda fit because of price difference about  dollar3000 Versa because no fold flat or flip and fold seats Yaris because I needed a 4 door hatch and PT because of fuel economy I also chose the Aveo because by far it had the best styling of all of them The seat covers are durable and attractive and I loved the carbon fiber look trim On to the driving it is a much better driving experience than would be expected from a budget sub compact It is quiet zippy for such a low horsepowerand overall handles as well if not better than some of the pricier cars I have owned Plenty of cargo room with flip and fold seats too Love it
1,I have owned my CRV for one week I traded in my 2005 Lexus RX 330 and was afraid I had made a mistake but after only a week I really like this vehicle It is comfortable quiet and has all the power you really need I also have a 350Z if I want to go fast I wouldnt want anyone to think this is equal to a Lexus but for the price and economy it is much more pratical for the kind of miles I put on a car in a year It has lots of storage even with three other adults in the car It has just about everything you need in an onroad SUV I looked at others like the Toyota RAV 4 but none of them matched the CRV
0,This is really a fine little car I am a professional but got tired of sending my gas money to foreign lands The Aveo gets good mileage 27 in city 37 on highway Not great but good Considering the price of the car great mieage The result is a very affordable car that gets good mileage has some style and is fun to drive I am amazed that is has not given me any trouble at all I drive it a lot We took it on a 1600 mile drive recently and it is more comfortable than a larger sedan My main complaint is the small sun visor and weak cup holders I would buy another great car
1,Improved ride and handling over my 03 CRV but I miss the flip up rear window The maintenance minder is kind of silly and it seems that it will be a pain to use I prefer a written maintenance schedule which is no longer in the owners manual The adjustable steering wheel is ok but I usually set it once and leave it alone The spare sits in the floor well with the valve stem pointed down which means that you have to remove it to check the air
0,If you are looking for a low cost alternative to a used vehicle the Aveo is a great choice Gas mileage has ranged from 324 to 366 mpg I had been shopping for a new commuter for about 9 months and had seen the special value Aveo advertised by two local dealers for less than  dollar8000 a couple of times Finally decided that the next time I saw them offered in this price range I would buy I ended up paying  dollar7660 The Aveo should serve very well as an economical run about Its not the Prius that I really wanted but was 14 the cost and still gets very respectable mpg
1,Ive only owned my 07 CRV for 4 full days and so far I am loving it With 166 hp its not a car for speedsters so if youre hoping to buy a fast car stick to vehicles with V6 engines What the CRV lacks in power it more than makes up with its standard safety features such as ABS VSA with traction control EBD TPMS to name a few Many have written that the ride is very rough When driving on uneven roads full of potholes or covered with rough surface any car will feel the same way I am not too crazy about the manually operated drivers seat height adjustment and the limited choice of colors Overall though it was sure worth the wait and the price wasnt that bad
0,Its a great car for the money After all you wouldnt buy a car like this unless low cost was important to you Its very stylish inside and out and seems well made so far 1200 miles Engine is fuel efficient but I am surprised it isnt more so Chevrolet and the Korean manufactures of the Aveo could make some simple improvements to make it a great carvariable speed intermittent wipers actual electronic door lock buttons more storage better cup holder location in the front seat etc Overall it is a good car for those on a tight budget
1,Totally made for a female Raising the drivers seat up sends the whole seat closer to the front of the vehicle Not enough leg room Armrests are super tiny my elbow is always on the edge of the rest Other then those items its great Drives like a sports car Plenty of power good gas mileage
0,Fantastic carconsistantly get 32 in the city w AC on and well over 40 MPG on the highway Drive the car reasonably as its meant to be  its not a sports or performance car so it shouldnt be driven as such  keep the cruise on the highway at 7075 MPG and youll be suprised Yes the Aveo can go 90 MPH if it needs to No problems at all with car at 13500  Many compliments on LT Sedan Well worth the money No complaints at all except the cup holders
1,It makes loud brake noises especially at low speeds In addition I hear the chip noises go on and off every time I accelerate the car I dont think my next car is a Honda again
0,Its my wifes first new car and turns out I use it more than her I just love it We just came back from a 1500 mile trip and it performed perfectly
1,We bought this little guy to replace our 1992 Accord wagon totaled from behind and its been a pleasure driving it The leather interior is very comfortable and of high quality The only thing Im not keen on is the lack of ability to punch the gas when you need a sudden acceleration and in Miami which has more idiot drivers per capita than most other cities this is a must You can give it a slow push and it will accelerate relatively well but if you try to punch it it just kind of dies I guess thats what you get with a 4 cylinder engine you trade a little bit of safety for fuel economy
0,Im really enjoying my Aveo Its fun to drive and gets great mileage We drive all aroung town with 4 people in it all the time Thats two adults and two teenagers and were comfortable The only problem weve had is a bad oil pump at 5000 miles It was fixed with no problem
1,Both my wife and I are not thrilled with our CRV Mileage is poor 23 on highway or around town seats not all that comfortable Very uncomfortable on long trips black stickers on door pillars peelingrear differential was howling and had to have fluid changed on going Honda problem tires almost at wear indicators with 20000 miles we have had regular maintenance Honestly we are considering getting rid of it and replacing with a RAV 4
0,I must say that even though I purchased this car for my wife I really want it for myself I drive it any chance I get It is actually quite sporty in both the design and handling Very little came with the car in terms of features but it is worth it I have pretty decent credit and although I may not have gotten the best rate out there I still feel like my payment is nothing Most importantly it is a safe car with side airbags standard and has a great crash rating hope we never have proof of that
1,When it came time for me to buy a new car my son talked me into test driving a Honda CRV I absolutely fell in love with it For the price it has more amenities than any other car I test drove and I test drove lots of different cars I have the LX L model with the rear view camera navigation system and great stereo system I am averaging 25 mpg this last year city and highway combined Around town I usually get 21 mpg but on the highway I get as high as 31 mpg This was also the best gas mileage posted on any car I drove I cannot remember when Ive enjoyed a car so much One thing that impressed me overall was I was not exhausted after driving a long distance
0,I have owned this car for a few months and I do like it but the gas mileage is not what I was told or expected I love the appearance and the look to the car especially for what I spent I have a few concerns
1,I bought this car in 2007 and Ive gotten nothing but compliments on the design Smooth ride but weak power on acceleration My car mileage on highways is typically 281 mpg and 278 on city roads based on 87 octane Seats could be more comfortable as they are a bit stiff esp for long distance driving Love how the back door opens up not sideways like the RAV4 One of my complaints is that I have to turn off my front lights manuallydoes not turn off with the engine Also when you drop anything between the 2 front seatsaround the console its extremely difficult to findretrieve whatever you dropped Overall its a greatlooking car with good gas mileage
0,The low cost of ownership in this hatchback is what initiallly attracted us The main thing that finally sold us was that both my wife 53 125 lb and I 62 220 lb could find reasonably comfortable driving positions Many other small cars do a poor job of accomodating those of us who arent about the standard 58 It is surprisingly roomy insidethere is actually enough headroom to for me to sit up in the backseat The Aveos performance and mileage while adequate could be better but you cant have everything at this price point
1,I have owned two Hondas before this purchase This is the first CRV I am not happy with it and will replace as soon as possible The interior is cheap there are issues with the differential that I learned have been an issue for quote some time Now with only 22000 miles I have to replace all 4 tires Never had any trouble with my Honda Accords Should have bought another one Miles isnt as good as I thought either Drove terrible in the snow and ice
0,I just love this little car It is so fun to drive The gas mileage is a little less then I thought it would be but I get about 30 in overall driving It has lots of leg and head room It feels as if you are sitting in a real chair and has good interior stylingflashy dashboard and stereo knobs etc It has a lot of little extras
1,Honda just keeps getting better The wife has driven this hard for 9 months and 14000 miles now I suspect the car is not even broken in yet still drives like brand new Comfort and driveability is a strong point Im a big 61 and after a three hour trip behind the wheel I feel like Ive been sitting on my couch relaxing A lot of thought went into the details from the way you can configure the fold down seats to auto open for the moon roof Every button seems to know exactly what you want to do Gas milage is surprising for a car with this much room seats fivestuff 24 around town almost 30 open road Turning circle is crazy tight feels like you can do a Uturn in your garage
0,Had no intention of purchasing a new vehicle but the warranty and price pushed me over the edge After spending thousands on used vehicles over the past 3 years I wised up and purchased this little hatchback I am 62 and a little over 250 pounds and I have no trouble getting in or out of the car I am amazed at the amount of room My only suggestion would be change the cup holders but for the price how can I complain The car has great fit and finish and the room inside is amazing I even get people telling me how much they like my car when I am in town
1,Bought this as my first new car after driving it in 4 inches of snow and being very impressed at its performance there and finding a 2007 on the lot in December Since purchase have been nothing but disappointed Terrible gas mileage 21 on mostly highway cheap radio slow acceleration rough ride performance ridiculuously cheaplooking base wheels no covered storage in front besides glove boxes nearlyuseless table between seats uncomfortable driving position difficulty in seat belting child in with booster seat and much more had me looking up tradein value in the first month This car makes me miss my deteriorating 2000 Taurus with 110000 miles greatly
0,Having owned and driven this car for 2 months I am impressed with its comfort and driveability in city traffic We have studded tires where I live and the rough pavement on local freeways is a bit harsh to drive on but all other characteristics are fine This is my 18th vehicle over 39 years and it delivers everything I thought it would I bought this car as an inexpensive alternative to a used vehicle for good mileage in city work commutes and it fills the bill perfectly
1,Bought this brand new 07 silver CRV AWD EX  Very Fun to drive Nice interior design Very Nice exterior design Previous car was 03 Accord LX and the CRV has a simlar engine layout I do most of the minor maintenace myself so its not much of a change from doing maintenace on CRV compared to Accord Its great they re designed the way the oil filter is attached as compared to Accord it is not horizontal rather vertical so no messy oil spilling out as much when removing the oil filter Some say the 4 cylinder is low in power I dont drive like a nascar driver  but on the freeways I see no lack of power when power is needed
0,I love my Aveo It is a fun sporty car It has a lot of little extras Ive gotten some people asking me if it is a Volkswagen If you compare a Jetta with it youll find that the body is similar It has lots of leg and head room It feels as if you are sitting in a real chair and has good interior stylingflashy dashboard and stereo knobs etc The engine is spaced out enough that a doityourself mechanic can work on it comfortablyIts an American car which hopefully means cheaper parts though I have heard that American cars tend to break down more so well see in the long run whats least expensive With chrome lined lights a spoiler and a sunroof this is the cutest little car Chevy makes
1,Picked up this car last Friday Rear cargo ceiling seatbelt latch cover fell off infront of sales rep Disappointed to find no headlight auto onoff feature or Homelink Armrest got in the way of seat belt latch No fog lamps and top of headrest tilts too far forward for my wifes 5 height Interior design and headroom is excellent Dash layout is perfectly aligned with driver My wife pulled down the vanity mirrors and was quite upset to find each mirror without lights Sideview mirros do not have integrated signals which doesnt make sense given the safety factor built in Steering connects very lightly to the road Would have liked the tail antenna to be replaced with small dome
0,I was very happy with this buy because its my first car I needed somthing cheap and good The look was great and the interior was great for the price range What won me over was the look and the price and the miles this thing gets I support American cars so I love this car Sorry Yaris
1,This is my first Honda Have had Chevy Toyota Mitsubishi Ford Volkswagen etc This is the first time I write a review on a car Only reason I really like this car all around We just returned from a 7500 mile 30 day trip Never stepped out the car unable to move my rather stiff limbs got 293mpg over the whole trip mostly highway driving but still Have now 12k miles on the car and did 2 oil changes at a dealer at a cost of  dollar 28 each It is the best overall car I have ever owned and I am officially old
0,I bought this vehicle primarily for fuel economy I consistently get 3640 mpg in normal driving Babying it a bit has returned several 4345 mpg tankfulls Running it hard on the freeway 80 mph drops the mileage to the 3033 range Comfort is good for a car of this class  comparable to my old Honda Civic I love the lumbar support in the drivers seat The transmission is geared well to deal with the cars modest engine torque while coming up to speed and cruises well at highway speeds I have not encountered any high speed or crosswind instability Vehicle is built tight and after 3500 miles has proven to be quite reliable Cornering and braking are better than I expected
1,Very good car and not bad mileage Could be better but on a long trip I average about 29 to 31 miles a gallon Not bad
0,I bought this car because it was cheap but I feel like I got a lot of car for the money I rented a 2006 Malibu over the summer and I think this is comparable in styling and driving except for being only 4cyl Its sharp and comfortable Great visibility and you feel like youre sitting high up Love that it has an interior trunk and gas release Good car for the money I hope I find it reliable for years to come
1,After all I have read about this car I agree with the lack of hispeed passing ability but that is not a major issue for the day to day driving I do
0,Good car for its price Me and my wife use it for commuting She drives it in the morning I use it at night Good gas milleage
1,It looks good performs poorly The gas mileage is 2021 mpg City and 23 mpg Highway CRV has Squeaks   and Rattles in car Vehicle shifts rough from 1st to 2nd from stop start and go The dealer says its in electronic program transmission CRV Pulls hard to right on road at lowhigh speeds I have been to a Honda Dealer who says there is a Honda Service Bulletin out Since 012007 prior to the car being purchased and requires New Steering column rodspins to be later installed which are back ordered from Honda so a proper wheel alignment can been done on a new car what I was Never notified by the selling dealer prior to or after purchase So be alert for that Noticeable wind noise at 55 mph
0,I love my new Aveo I did a lot of research on small cars and pricing due to our budget and when I test drove my 2007 Aveo it drove as smooth as butter So quiet and comfy It felt smoother than other more expensive cars The gas mileage will save me even more money Anything after 2006 is great on this model and with the low pricing on this car go for it get the 2007 We are happy campers
1,I fell in love with the Element when the very first one came out with the exception of the panel on the vehicle In 07 when I saw the SC I fell in love all over again This car may look like a toaster but from the inside out it is an exceptional vehicle I love the room it provides on the inside to how theres no panel on the outside Ive had my SC since Nov 06 and still have it today with over 37000 miles on it and I havent had to this day any problems with my SC except taking it in for regular maintenance I feel its one of the best investments ull ever make and u wont regret it one bit For everyone else whos had problems I think its the driver not the car
0,I think this is a cute fun reliable car I am glad I bought it Nice transportation to and from my job as well as around town I check out many cars and it was a toss between the Aveo Scion or the PT Cruiser In the end I decided on the Aveo 5 hatchback I got bright blue which is a pretty color but not my choice Others I would have had to wait for and I needed transportation in a hurry I would have preferred the new cinnamon pretty yellow or slate blue All and all I am satisfied with my new little car and it fits in my driveway behind my husbands larger van I needed a compact car for that reason I have one suggestion regarding the side view mirrow
1,Cons The Element is my first Honda and probably the last Reliability and build quality was surprisingly poor with subpar components Tires wore out at 24000 miles all new brakes rotors   and pads at 30000 speedometer broke at 5000 miles windshield replaced twice with mystery cracking drivers seat cushioning compressed and wrinkled and scheduled services are over priced The ride of the SC model is very harsh if the road is less than perfect  I had to stop drinking coffee in the car due to it too easily splashing Brakes are noisy even shortly after replacement Very uncomfortable for long drives due to no dead pedal
0,Recently bought the 2007 special value model Chevy Aveo 5 hatchback I love the style and color spicy orange It is a very nice little car especially for the price It is a base model so not fancy in any way but comfortable roomy and zippy I am very happy so far Spicy orange style
1,I love my Honda Element but the blinds spots are annoying when backing up I have had to replace the brakes on the rear after only 17000 miles Honda Corp has not followed up on my complain either to resolve the issue I have owned many vehicles and have never had to service calipers or replace brakes with so little miles Very disappointed in Honda in how they handled the issue
0,Waited a long time to get it two months It has a sporty exterior spoiler et al Luxurious interior and very comfortable Lots of extras included A pleasure to drive pep good brakes ease of parking and a real buy for the money Just what I needed for around the town and brief trips Recommend it for anyone who needs a runabout with style
1,We bought a 2007 Honda element sc model silver 18 inch mags sc package right now it has a little under 6000 miles on it and its been in the Honda shop a total of 4 times First it had a noise underneath the driver side so they said it was a strut assembly The replaced under warranty which is good still the noise was there We take it back the second time for another kind of noise on the driver side doors they adjusted them fixed for a while again back in the shop now said they hooked up some microphones all over it and found out the noise underneath is the steering rack So in the shop again oh yea this thing gets very poor gas mileage the power is lackluster and the windows are noisy
0,After three months of painstaking dilemma I finally got this car My first ever car Looks are great both in and out Its easy to maneuver comfortable very economical and lots of space inside I had test driven almost a dozen of cars but the Chevy had its advantages Thats why I chose it
1,I was drawn to the Element by the interior flexibility and suicide doors and it doesnt look like a minivan My previous car however was a Subaru Forester and I think Honda could take some lessons from Subaru on building AWD drive trains This car has torque steer on hard acceleration and there is a lot of wheel spin on wet pavement Once you get the element going its a hoot to drive I am interested though to see how this car will perform in snow a little worried The ABS works well which will be good for snow driving I miss not having the headlights turn off when I turn the ignition off although the warning bell has kept me out of trouble so far I could do without sunroof
0,The car is much nicer than any other compact I have owned Bought as a second car and a grocery getter This does more than deliver It is smooth quiet comfortable and has about as much power as you would expect from a compact
1,Its exactly what I expected Only car I have ever owned in which I do not get a backacheamazing support on short or long trips Split rear door is extremely efficientinfinitely better than most splits   and better than all single doors Very useful for utility carrying big   and lots of things Great traction in snow Only 3 negatives which I expectedrear seat is useful only in a pinch had to remove headrests from rear seats to see but dont use them anywaychoppy ride Otherwise turning radius is greatheadlights greatlots of stg placeseasy to clean Got armrest stg option and love it Would not suggest for young kids with carseats Great for dogsleave backs of rear seats down always
0,I love this car It rides nice looks great and you can drive it for a long time before having to fill up
1,Thank you Honda for releasing the SC The SC resolves the two main issues we had about the Element unpainted surfaces and the rubber floor Overall we are very satisfied with our Element SC For our needs it is a complete package The fact that you do not see one at every corner makes it stand out even more Why drive a boring miniSUV when you can get the complete package w the Element
0,GM cannot figure out why they cant sell cars Here is a pleasing cool practical contender in the Mini club but whos to know Great gear box precise steering feel amazingly quiet with a compliant controlled ride The only weakness I could find the seat has little support you sit on it not in it and the headrest is somewhat annoying and doesnt support the head comfortably But a definite must drive when considering Fit Yaris etc A well developed package for allaround use that puts a smile on your face
1,I cant say enough how much this is my favorite car I have owned so far including the 03 Mercedes CLK320 I traded in for this fine SUV I got the Nighthawk Black Pearl w black tinted windows giving it a very sleek headturning appearance They finally fixed the greypaneled look that has kept me from fully appreciating the exterior It rides firm but sporty while still feeling as tight as a vault The engine noise is not a concern at all Acceleration is fine since I just like to cruise in it I already used its immense hauling capabilities each of the first 3 days I had it This car is a keeper
0,I looked and test drove Honda Fit Toyota Scion Toyota Yaris and Kia Rio Former Suzuki Grand Vitara Owner 2005 Lease  ABSOLUTELY THE BEST DECISION WOULD BE AVEO I have little to NO engine noise whatsoever very smooth suspension it does not have the torsion bar ind suspension lots of cool little features that are common on premiums great handling and response and EXCELLENT fuel mileage and I could compare that to my families Toyota Prius Just the BEST investment I could have made
1,I bought a 4WD LX model a little over a year ago This is my fourth Honda and it is a disappointment compared to my previous Accords I cannot see the tach or speedometer in bright sunlight even with the instrument lights on This is just bad design The drivers seat has a wear hole in it after 15K miles The interior plastic is cheap and scratches easily This is a vehicle built to a low price and it shows
0,I absolutely love my new Aveo It handles great and feels bigger inside than it looks from the outside Tons of trunk space Plenty of leg room in the front The adjustments on the driver seat are wonderful I can drive long distances without feeling fatigued and sore when I arrive
1,After test driving many SUVs I could not believe how this car could have the best road feel since its shorter then most of the ones I tested It was not the quietest or the smoothest ride but by far the one I loved the most I liked many cars in my 50 years of driving but this one I LOVE
0,Comfortable car Very nice interior and exterior design and for the price very well equipped On the other hand poor gas mileage for this engine Noisy with the struts
1,We traded in our 2006 Civic because we needed more room for our two kids I had looked at the element in previous years but didnt care for the looks Well Honda took care of that with the SC
0,I hated the dealership I got this car from so for all my service I go to a different dealership but outside of the dealership the car is great I get 27mpg city driving the get up and go is a little slow but its just a 4 cylinder so thats okay she handles turns great and handles the occasional long drive out of state Great first car for me Body lines are clean and the size and shape are ideal for Jersey driving and parking Love it and would recommend this car
1,The suspension is a little stiff but I got used to it Havent enjoyed driving a vehicle this much since my VW van in the early 70s
0,Overall I am pleased with the fuel efficiency but little else I started having trouble when the drivers side door broke off completely I got online to do some research and have found that I am not the only one with this issue I decided to repair the handle myself just to find out that it will take more than just removing the interior door panel I switched from Ford to Chevy in hopes of easy repair work but I miss my Ford already
1,We bought an 03 Element EX when they first came out and loved it so much so we upgraded to a Rally Red 05 EX wside curtain airbags in March of 2005 In Sept 06 my wife and two young children 1   and 3 year olds were involved in a head on collision at 50 mph with an inattentive Ford F150 All three walked away from the accident with only minor bruises and burns from the airbag There was no doubt we would buy another We decided on a silver SC and we ABSOLUTELY love the new styling inside and out Great car for the kids dog   and all of your stuff I would highly recommend this vehicle
0,This car is very fun to drive and has a cute body but those are about the only good things I have to say about the car In the very few months I have had the car I have had the breaks replaced had to buy a new battery and have had the whole gear shift unit replaced It is not practical at all There is no space what so ever in the back seat The inside paint scratches way too easily and the stereo razzes very easily Over all just not a practical car Oh and if you get one with a fin on the back forget about rear visibility
1,My wife was against this box as I kept dropping the hints for the past 3 years MUCH more comfortable for a 65 230 male I told her Being that the 2003 model was a rough ride at best  she was hesitant considering I bought it without test driving I was not disappointed Lots of room fun to drive and SHE LOVES IT Home run Literally 
0,Ive had my Cobalt for a little over a month Its a wonderful first car I read reviews here before buying this car I read about someone hearing a cricket noise when the air conditioner was on I hear this noise every time I have the AC on it can get annoying after a while because I hear it over my music Ive put aver 1000 miles on it since I got it Now it has about 42000 miles on it It gets around 2628 mpg in town Its a wonderful car  I love it
1,This car is awful I feel so unsafe in this car plus it is so uncomfortable and I am very short The car rattles and the mechanics cant find the problem Gas mileage is not what they say it is The tires that come with the car do not last I would not recommend this car to anyone
0,I wanted a safe dependable car to send my daughter off to college She liked the sporty look and we shopped until we found one with the bells and whistles The car has 37000 miles on it so the bumper to bumper has expired barely 36000 While she was driving from Nashville the power steering just quit working Im glad she wasnt in a turn Dealership and GM are not very sympathetic but when I googled Cobalt power steering I found that this problem is widespread I hope that anyone considering the Cobalt will use google and research this power steering failure
1,When I test drove the Fit I listened for road noisecabin noise because I drive quite a bit I should have driven the car longer The cabin noise is simply overwhelming at times I will consider other tires to see if this helps but the noise is so loud it makes the car feel cheap and tinny Dont get me wrong I love this car  I just cant stand the amount of road noise I hear And my wife doesnt like the stereo playing at full blast in order to drown it out
0,Before I had a 2001 Chevy Cavalier that had reached 225000 miles I thought that the Cobalt would be comparable to the Cavalier boy was I wrong I love the style of the car very cute inside and out The features are amazing XM MP3 jack remote start but the quality leaves much to be desired I have had to fix so much on it in two years broken tail light after two weeks of ownership squeaky sunroof loose seat fabric breaks and rotors replacedonly after 15000 mileft control arm radio buttons stopped working and BOTH remotes to my car are broken
1,I get 40 mpg on the hiway If it is cooler in the season and the ac doesnt need to be on that little car is great It will drop down to about 37 mpg hiway with the ac turned on Im planning on driving it up to NE Georiga next month so the truth will be known on the mpg then but Its great to fill it up on a meer 1000 while others are laying out 2050 dollar per fill up
0,This is an update from my 91307 post This is a great little car Fuel economy is 34 to 36 on my mostly highway commute at about 60 mph Got 40 mpg on trip once Seats are still comfortable Shifting is not as crisp as when new Never been back to dealer for any warranty service Oil change is super easy with the front cartridge filter and oversize filler cap Tires will need to be replaced before next winter
1,Its all wrong  The transmission setup is really awful The gearing ratio into first gear and second result in a noticeable hesitation as the computer tries to match up with the short gear and the computer fuel delivery system These tiny enginetrans crammed into a tiny space dont leave much room for clutch travel Whereby we have a short time to ease the clutch out and get moving The feel is not really smooth at all and I have always enjoyed sticks But in this car get the auto and spare yourself the grief This car even chatters backing up a hill I am sorry I bought mine its very peppy and looks racy and cute but I cant get comfortable with the transmission
0,Had my Cobalt for a few months now and Im really happy with it My last car was a Honda and Ive noticed that the Cobalt just feels more solid  right down to the thunk the doors make when they close Ive crossed 32mpg on the highway and the car rides like a much bigger vehicle Cant beat this car at the price I think Chevy came up with a winner this time
1,This car is fun to drive in good weather and gets great mileage but beware of driving it in the rain or snow It just doesnt handle snow and ice like all the other Hondas that Ive owned since 1974 I actually had to have it towed once and the snow wasnt really that deep Tires are expensive and hard to find A big part of the money you save in gas goes towards maintenance and tires  dollar dollar dollar I should have purchased a Civic
0,I ordered this car after combing through the entire STL region looking for a blue 24 ss with sunroof and airbags Car came and was surprided to find xm was standard I really didnt care for it but now after listening i cant live wo it Also FM and AM reception with antenna is poor Gas mileage is tricky In order to get 34 mpg you have to drive like 55 mph on the highway At 65mph Im already at 25 K in 5th gear could definitely use another gear for more gas saving Overall I average 29mpg with 7030 highwaycity driving Handling is sport like but it was easily be pushed over its limits with body roll Ride quality is very nice however very smooth Im looking forward to modding it
1,This car is not good if you are planning to have children you cant fit the stroller in the trunk with many grocery bags The back seat is small and with the car seat you can only fit one adult There is not much leg room for a tall man in the passenger seat your knees hit the dash board Unless you live where the roads are paved smooth this car isnt for you if you go over a pebble it feels like you wrecked the car I didnt know the tires didnt have locks and some low life robbed all my alloy wheels and tires cost 1000
0,This car is very well rouded It has performance handling style fuel economy and isnt too expensive  dollar19500 brand new wall but 6 disc changer Power is solid up to 3500 rpm and then she just screams all the way up to redline at 6500 rpm with an auto trans The power is exhilarating Handling is absoltutely superb while maintaining a pleasant ride even my wife doesnt complain Fuel economy is good considering the power 175 HP I usually get about 26 miles per gallon with a pretty even split of city and highway drivingand my pedal to the floor I think this car is the total package I test drove a few other competitors with comparable economy and the Cobalt SS was the obvious choice
1,I have owned 5 Hondas over the last 10 years and may be a little bias But Honda has done it again At first I was turned off by the small engine   and the kind of high price for its class I decided to give it a chance and took one home for a test drive Very impressed with power of little engine however dont buy if speed is your thing I bought a manual and have had no problems getting where I need to be and getting on the highway works great for the most part Very impressed with build quility solid car with great gas mileage If good gas mileage and quilty are your thing then this car is best in its class Only had car 2 weeks will make another input after 3 months
0,After 3 weeks and some 1800 miles my Cobalt and I have come to know what to expect from each other This mild mannered compact rocket is a solid commuter at about 32mpg at average highway speeds of 7080mph What is truly surprising is that when you need a little burst of excitement or feel the need to circumnavigate the occasional left lane obstacle a quick crack to 3rd and back to 4th makes you want to kiss your sales man for suggesting you test drive the SC As for the responsive handling considering the base model is the offspring of the Caviler it is a blast to drive even with some mild under steer Style is 1st rate in the sport compact class Only one bad thing GM why no SC in 2008
1,I was really not even going to look at the fit but my mechanic encouraged me to Well Im pleasantly suprised Its got the fuel economy for my weekday commute and lots of space for my weekend dogwalks and camping trips Its got more zip than you would think but its not the Civic and it does get chucked around a bit in high winds Bad thing is there arent many of them so there are no real good deals to be hand But at the price you really cant got wrong
0,Purchased on Sept 1 06 10000 Kms to date This car is a blast to drive I can barely stand to drive it slow This car is not much of a town car but is totally a highway car Power is more than enough for daily driving and space upfront is great Rear seat space is excellent for a compact car Trunk space could be a little better but again its a compact car My only regret is I was unable to get the G85 Recaro Package due to order date and GM product management difficulties
1,Having owned my Fit for 6 months I do NOT and will NOT recommend it IMHO Honda needs to start over I have lots of issues with it First is the Windshield wipers WHY does that passenger wiper have to swing all the way into the drivers view I feel this is a Safety Issue However I guess Honda doesnt care I could go on and on with all my gripes with the car There are a few more that NEED to be mentioned The Seats are not comfortable for long rides The gas tank making annoying sloshing noises For those that dont hear it I have to say HMMMAre you DEAF Rear license plate holder allowing the plate to rattle The paddle shifers on the steering wheel boggles my mind WHY
0,This is a great car for the money I got it with a  dollar1000 rebate so it ended up being cheaper than a similarly equipped Aveo  and theres much more car here Currently using toptier 87 fuel and synthetic oil between town and highway driving im getting about 35 milesgallon on a 13 gallon tank I can get over 400 miles and still have over a gallon of fuel left The audio input jack is a great standard feature and for those who wish to upgrade their audio on their own theyll be pleased to find the battery in the trunk I almost bought a used ford focus for around  dollar10K but This car after rebate taxes etc ended up being 13K and wasnt somebody elses problem No regrets
1,The car really feels much bigger than it really is I was trying to drive it under 55 and it wasnt easy The car responds and is very willing 75 miles and the gas gauge has hardly moved Should get better after break in Took bumps very well Didnt feel like the car was gonna shake apart Got passed by some big rigs on route 80 on my way to upstate NY and the car held the road I didnt feel small at all
0,I bought my Cobalt for the rebates otherwise Id be driving an import That said the Cobalt is a big improvement over the outdated Cavalier Excellent fuel economy Ive seen 36mpg and with only 2000mi it will improve when things loosen up The metallic orange paint gets attention and the 22L Ecotec is one of GMs best engines ever However a good engine and decent styling cant hide all the places GM cheaped out Such as lock placement that makes them impossible to use while youre seated in the car or the solid grey interior door panels it would have been much classier to continue the dashs two tone them into the doors or the cheap feeling steering wheel and shifter
1,I have 2000 miles on my Fit and like it all right It doesnt have the handling stability and gas mileage that my 94 and 96 civic HBs had Ive about had it with cars that you cant see where they begin or end from inside until you bang them against the curb The front clearance is too low But it gets decent mileage 43 hwy mpg best thus far The seats are not very comfortable You ride low and feel every bump Not so in my civic HB Cabin is loud and the engine and trans buzz and rev a bit on the AT The shifters are nifty in sport mode but trouble in D mode Seems they should disengage in D mode
0,We got the Cobalt early May 07 and by late May I have almost 4000 miles on it already and it seems like a pretty decent car Has some pretty good pep for a 4cyl fuel economy is great compared to the SUV we traded in for it however not the 34 mpg that they advertise still Im getting around 27mpg The stereo system cranks good for a stock radio and CD player We can not fit the whole family in it leagally or safely for that matter but thats what the wifes minivan is for All in all Id have to say Id give it a thumbs up lets see what breaks on it in the first 50K or 100K miles
1,Ive had this car for three months 2100 miles so far My concerns are the following the engine revs when I step on the brakes but not always The brakes seem flimsy and just dont feel right The paint job seems to be cheap Im noticing orange peel surface and there are spots especially near the windshield where the clear coat is worn off or never existed I dont seem to get the gas mileage that I should be I drive about 85 percent city and usually get about 31 mpg I dont think Ill keep this car long and I worry about how it will look and run after 2 years Dont get the chrome shifter knob After three months it comes loose all the time and no longer lines up properly
0,I know that the Cobalt is an upgrade from the Cavalier but its way beyond that The cCobalt is much more comfortable and rides much smoother I would recommend this car to everyone Its great for travel or just your everyday driving Chevy is definitely a winner with this one
1,I have put over 10000 miles on this car My prime reasons for purchasing this car was safety reasons and mileage in an economic package I get an average of 38 miles  gallon My best results was a staggering 49 mg traveling  65 mh with the worst at 32 I am pleased with the functionality My teenage boys like to drive it but do not want to sit in the back The younger kids dont mind The car has a lot of room a good sound package The engine can be a little noisy at higher rpm The advantage of the VTEC engine can be felt if driving alone
